2018-01-15,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Palm Beach, FL","Palm Beach, FL, United States","[-80.0364297, 26.7056206]",donald-trump-weekly-address-january-15-2018,"I have a dream. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s immortal words, delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, have inspired Americans of all background since they were spoken on that historic day in 1963.
Dr. King's dream is our dream. It is the American dream. It's the promise, stitched into the fabric of our nation, etched into the hearts of our people, and written into the soul of humankind. It is the dream of a world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from. It is the dream of a nation that offers life of dignity and hope to every American, regardless of color or creed.
It is the dream of a nation faithful to its founding principle that we all created equal. This sacred principle was the cause for which Dr. King, and so many other historic Americans, sacrificed in places like Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery and Memphis. They were heroes who led our nation forward toward a future that is more just and more free.
Fifty years ago the spring, Dr King was cruelly taken from this world by an assassin's bullet. But the promise he fought for could never be taken away. His words, his deeds, they live on forever. And the cause for which he gave his life only gained strength and force and power with the passage of time.
Last week, I was so pleased to be joined by Dr King's niece, Alveda, as I signed into law the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park Act. This important legislation will ensure that the beautiful historic park continues to tell Dr. King's story for generations to come.
On this cherished day, we honor the memory of Reverend King, and we rededicate ourselves to glorious future, where every American from every walk of life can live free from fear, liberated from hatred, and uplifted by boundless love for their fellow citizens.
I ask every citizen to join me in remembering this great American hero, and to carry on his legacy of justice, equality and freedom. God bless the memory of Reverend King and God bless the United States of America."
2018-01-08,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the American Farm Bureau Federation Convention,"Nashville, TN, United States","[-86.7816016, 36.1626638]",donald-trump-speech-american-farm-bureau-nashville-january-8-2018,"Thank you very much. Oh, you're so lucky. You people know real estate because they have -- all these rooms all over this beautiful building are packed, but you're here with us. Right? [Applause] And I say, packed with our people, so it's great.
But thank you very much, Secretary Perdue, for the kind introduction. There could be no better person to be our Secretary of Agriculture -- a man known, trusted, and respected by your industry. That's for sure.
I'm thrilled to be back in the amazing state of Tennessee. [Applause] Here, as the state slogan goes, we see America at its absolute best. And you're doing well. You're doing a lot better since November 8th, I might add. [Applause, Laughter]
At the same time, it's true of the people gathered here today, in our nation's farmer -- and you know that -- our nation's farmers are just the most incredible people, and we are doing a job for you. You're seeing it like nobody else -- regulation, death tax, so much. You're a big beneficiary, and you're really producing like nobody else. So I just want to thank you for that. [Applause]
And that's why I'm so honored to be the first President to address the American Farm Bureau in more than 25 years. What happened? Where are they? What happened? [Applause] What happened? Where are they?
And you know this is your 99th year, so I was very disappointed to hear that. [Laughter] You understand. A hundred is so much cooler, I have to be honest. [Laughter] So I'll be back, I think. Next year, I'll come back. All right? We'll come back. [Applause]
I want to thank Governor Haslam and Mrs. Haslam -- wonderful people -- for joining us, along with members of the Tennessee congressional delegation. And I, sort of, have this beautiful list that I wrote. Some of us came in on Air Force One. And they're great people, and they're fighting for you.
In addition to the Governor and your great Secretary, Senator Bob Corker. And they're out here someplace. Bob? [Applause] Senator Lamar Alexander is here. Senator Pat Roberts. [Applause] Thank you, Pat. Oh, does he love the farmers. Pat, does he love those farmers. Right, Pat? Stand up, Pat. Do you love the farmers, Pat? ""Yes."""" He'll come in -- we're talking about a different subject
Representative Diane Black -- terrific woman. [Applause] Representative Marsha Blackburn. Marsha. [Applause] Representative Scott DesJarlais. I love that name. [Applause] Hi, Scott. Thank you, Scott. Right from the beginning. Representative Chuck Fleischmann. [Applause] Representative David Kustoff. Thank you, David. [Applause] Representative Phil Roe. [Applause]
I talk about Zippy, so I don't have to mention Zippy Duvall. I'll talk about him in this speech. [Applause] Tom Nassif. Where's Tom? Tom? Thank you, Tom. And Mark Morris, State Senate Majority Leader.
All right, I've done my job now. All right? Okay. [Applause] I've done my job. Did I do a good job? Did I leave out anybody? I hope not. It's always trouble when you do that. You left out one person; it's like for the rest your life they never speak to you, so -- [Laughter] -- it's always very dangerous. Thank you very much. I'm also thrilled to see one of my good friends and early supporters -- and that is Tom. And I just said, president and CEO Tom Nassif.
I also want to thank the American Farm Bureau and -- Zippy, I said I was going to mention you, and I am going to mention you because you have been there since the beginning. And that tractor that you drove during the inauguration was a very, very special moment. So I want to thank Zippy Duvall. Thank you, Zippy. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] It was a special day.
From that day on, we have been working every day to deliver for America's farmers just as they work every single day to deliver for us. We know that our nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. Our continent was tamed by farmers. So true. Our armies have been fed by farmers and made of farmers. And throughout our history, farmers have always, always, always led the way.
Are you surprised to hear that, farmers? I don't think so. [Applause] You have led the way. Great people. The men and women in this room come from different backgrounds and from all across our land, but each of you carries the same title that's been proudly borne by patriots and pioneers, inventors and entrepreneurs, the title of -- very proudly -- American farmer. Thank you very much. [Applause]
You embody the values of hard work, grit, self-reliance and sheer determination we need to -- did you ever hear this expression? -- make America great again. Has anybody ever -- [Applause] --
And we're seeing already -- it's very early -- 11 months -- the incredible results. We have created more than 2 million new jobs since the election. Substantially more. Economic growth has surged past 3 percent, something that wasn't supposed to happen for a long time. We're way ahead of schedule. Unemployment is at a 17-year low. By the way, African American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our records. [Applause] Great. I told you.
The stock market is hitting one all-time record after another, boosting your 401(k)s and retirement accounts for everyday Americans. Everybody happy with your 401(k)? [Applause] Because if you're not, there's something very wrong. [Laughter]
I had a policeman in New York come up to me and said, Mr. President -- I was shaking hands -- I love our -- do we love our police and our uniform? [Applause] And he came up -- he was on line and we're taking pictures, and nice event, and he said, ""Sir
And I said, you know what, based on the stocks, 39 is not that good. You're not really doing that well. [Laughter] Don't tell your wife that. The American Dream is roaring back to life. And we have just signed into law the most significant tax cuts and reforms in American history. [Applause] It's a total of $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, with most of those benefits going to working families, small businesses, and who? The family farmer. [Applause] And I hate to say this, but your competing party wants to raise those taxes. They want to raise them. Can't let that happen. We've worked too hard to get them.
Businesses across America have already started to raise wages, and more than 100 companies have already given bonuses and other benefits to hundreds of thousands of workers as a result of these massive tax cuts. You see it happening every day. Today, they just announced more -- $1,000, sometimes more, per employee. Hundreds of thousands of employees, and overall millions of employees.
We have over a million workers that have already received a tax cut bonus, something that nobody even thought when we made the bill. Nobody thought of that. It happened. AT&T came out, another one came out, another one. Then they started copying. Now the ones that didn't get it, everyone is saying where's mine?
So they're all going to have it. So we never thought about it, and frankly, that worked out fantastically well -- even before the February date, where you're going to start seeing a lot more money in your paycheck.
And yet, every Democrat in the House and every Democrat in the Senate voted against tax cuts for the American farmer and for the American worker. But Republicans came together and delivered historic relief for our farmers and our middle class. [Applause] And it wasn't easy. And we cannot let anything happen to that. And if the Democrats ever had the chance, the first thing they would do is get rid of it and raise up your taxes, sometimes by 40, 50, 60 percent higher than you're paying right now.
We can't have that. That will undermine everything that we've done. You see the record business all over the world; they're talking about the United States again, all over the world. We cannot let anything happen to what we're doing. [Applause]
Under the really large tax cut -- I always call it massive; sometimes they say huge. [Laughter] Not a bad one. Huge tax cut. But our huge tax cut that we just passed, Americans will be paying less in taxes and keeping more of their own money to do what you want. You can save it. You can spend it. But it's all good for our country.
We've lowered tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit. [Applause] It's a big thing. Under this new law, the typical family of four earning $75,000 will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000 each, slashing their tax bill in half each year. [Applause]
American businesses are going from the highest tax rate in the developed world last year -- the highest in the developed world, think of it -- to one of the most competitive this year. From 35 percent -- which is unacceptable -- all the way down to 21 percent. And on top of that, you have a lot of advantages.
Small- and mid-size businesses will receive massive tax cuts. So a lot of the folks in this room. [Applause] They'll be able to deduct 20 percent of their business income. All American businesses, including American farmers, will be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of new equipment in the year you make the investment.
That is something that is tremendous. [Applause] That is something that I think is going to be the sleeper of the bill. You deduct it all in one year, as opposed to over many years. That's a tremendous thing.
And from now on, most family farms and small-business owners will be spared -- and you're going to be spared, and it really is the word punishment of the deeply unfair estate tax, known as the death tax -- so you can keep your farms in the family. [Applause] Get up. [Laughter] That was a tough one to get. That was a tough one. [Applause] Obviously, you love your families; otherwise, you wouldn't be standing for that one. Not going to help you much; going to help them a lot. [Applause, Laughter]
And what's been happening is, you know, you have a farm and it does well, but its value is more than the income really would justify. And what happens is families were forced to take these farms and sell them at a fire-sale price. And they go out and borrow too much money, and then they end up losing the farm. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen. So I congratulate you. That was a tough one to get approved of all of them. [Applause]
In every decision we make, we are honoring America's proud farming legacy. Years of crushing taxes, crippling regulations -- and it's never been worse than it was before I got here; it was horrible -- and corrupt politics left our communities hurting, our economy stagnant, and millions of hardworking Americans completely forgotten.
But they, guess what, are not forgotten anymore. No more. [Applause] I used to call them the forgotten men and women, and then when everyone saw them coming into the polls, the other side said, ""How do we get some of them?"""" They were unbelievable. They are forgotten no more. Remember that. You're forgotten no more. [Applause] Thank you.""
We're fighting for our farmers and we're fighting for our country, and for our great American flag. We are fighting for that flag. [Applause] We want our flag respected. We want our flag respected. And we want our national anthem respected also. [Applause, audience chants USA]
There's plenty of space for people to express their views and to protest, but we love our flag, we love our anthem. And we want to keep it that way. [Applause] As we put money back in the pockets of all Americans, including our farmers and ranchers, we're also putting an end to the regulatory assault on your way of life. And it was an assault indeed.
For years, many of you have endured burdensome fines, inspections, paperwork, and relentless intrusion from an army of regulators at the EPA, the FDA, and countless other federal agencies. Is that right, by the way? [Applause]
That's why I'm truly proud to report that within our first 11 months, my administration has cancelled or delayed over 1,500 planned regulatory actions or assaults -- more than any President in the history of the United States.
We have cut twenty-two regulations for every one new regulation. Think of that one. [Applause] You remember when I would talk to you -- when I'd come down to Tennessee and different places, I'd say, for every new regulation, we're going to cut one extra regulation. Right? We did better. One -- and we cut twenty-two. Instead of two, it was twenty-two. So we're very honored by that. [Applause]
If the Democrats got their way, they would reinstate every single regulation that we're cutting, and add many more burdensome rules that don't do anything but hamstring our economy and burden our people and our farmers.
My administration is in the process of rolling back a rule that hit our farmers and ranchers very, very hard -- the terrible Waters of the United States rule. You know about that. [Applause] It sounds so nice. It sounds so innocent. And it was a disaster. You know that. It sounded so good. The title is so beautiful. That's where it stopped. [Laughter]
It was absolutely -- and I have to say this: When I signed it, I said, oh, I'm going to be killed on this one. And you know what? People came to me and they saw me, and they were crying. Men that were tough and strong, women that were tough and strong -- they'd see me, their tears coming down their eyes because I gave them back their property, I gave them back their farms. They couldn't use them. [Applause] We ditched the rule, I call it. We ditched the rule. [Applause]
We're streamlining regulations that have blocked cutting-edge biotechnology, setting free our farmers to innovate, thrive, and to grow. Oh, are you happy you voted for me. [Laughter] You are so lucky that I gave you that privilege. The other choice wasn't going to work out too well for the farmers, I hate to tell you -- [Laughter] -- or the miners or anybody else. Because we know that our farmers are our future. So true.
We are removing harmful restrictions on forestry so you can log more timber, plant more trees, and export more renewable resources to other countries. Make money doing it. [Applause]
We're restoring the rule of law and protecting our cherished Second Amendment. [Applause] That was another thing that would have been gone had the other side won, but that wasn't so close. It didn't turn out to be. Remember? [Laughter] ""There is no way to 270."""" And there wasn't; we got 306 or 304. [Laughter] """"There was no way to 270."""" We ended up with 304
To level the playing field for our great American exporters -- our farmers and ranchers, as well as our manufacturers -- we are reviewing all of our trade agreements to make sure they are fair and reciprocal -- reciprocal, so important.
On NAFTA, I am working very hard to get a better deal for our country and for our farmers and for our manufacturers. It's under negotiation as we speak. [Applause] But think of it: When Mexico is making all of that money, when Canada is making all of that money, it's not the easiest negotiation. But we're going to make it fair for you people again.
Now we want to see even more victories for the American farmer and for the American rancher. Here today is Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts. And I'm looking forward to working with Congress to pass the Farm Bill, on time, so that it delivers for all of you. And I support a bill that includes crop insurance, unless you don't want me to. [Applause] Thank you. I guess you like it. Right?
Good, because if I heard no applause, I'd say, forget it, give it up. [Laughter] Now I can't do that. No, we're working hard on the farm bill and I think it's going to go well.
We're also moving swiftly to bring hope and prosperity to struggling rural communities. Last April, I commissioned a task force to meet with farmers and local communities to find the greatest barriers to rural prosperity.
Today, this task force is releasing its final report, and I am taking action right at that beautiful table, right out of the hills of Tennessee, right there. I'm going to be signing two very important bills.
The task force heard from farmers that broadband Internet access is an issue of vital concern to their communities and businesses. Is that a correct statement? [Applause]
That is why today, in a few minutes, I will take the first step to expand access to broadband Internet in rural America -- [Applause] -- so you can compete on a level playing field, which you were not able to do. Not fair. I will sign two presidential orders to provide broader and faster, and better Internet coverage. Make sure you look up @realDonaldTrump. Right? [Laughter] I have a feeling you get that anyway. It's our only way around the media. Fake media. [Applause]
I also want to thank Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who is here with us today, for her leadership on getting broadband. She's very, very strong on it -- getting it to rural America. Thank you, Marsha. [Applause]
The task force also focused on the need to rebuild our crumbling rural infrastructure. We've already slashed harmful restrictions that delayed critical infrastructure projects for decades and decades. Hard to believe. And we are proposing infrastructure reforms to ensure that our rural communities have access to the best roadways, railways, and waterways anywhere in the world. And that's what's happening.
We're going to be spending the necessary funds, and we're going to get you taken care of. It's about time. [Applause] And these projects are going to be built -- like I do -- under budget and ahead of schedule. Right? [Applause]
We are confronting the scourge of drug addiction and overdoses that plagues far too many of our rural communities and claims too many American lives all over our country.
We are fighting the opioid epidemic, and we are proudly supporting the men and women of law enforcement, including our wonderful ICE officers and Border Patrol Agents. These are incredible people who endorsed me during the campaign, and they are incredible. [Applause] They're doing a great job at the border, by the way.
We are going to end chain migration. We are going to end the lottery system, and we are going to build the wall. [Applause] Every American child deserves to grow up in a safe community and to live a life full of dignity, purpose and hope. That is the future we all seek and we will fiercely defend for all Americans.
We see the promise of tomorrow in the incredible young farmers who have joined us today -- students who are achieving incredible things through amazing organizations like FFA and 4-H. [Applause] Great people. Great people. Thank you. Great people. It's the future of our country. That's the future of our country. Great young people. Their devotion to our nation inspires us all. Really does.
But to ensure that our young people reach their potential, and our nation fulfills its destiny, we must remember and honor our history. We have to remember our history. Mostly good, some not so good, but you learn from it. We have to remember our history.
That is why I want to close my remarks today by commemorating one of the most important days in American history -- today, January 8th. The story began right here in Tennessee. And like so many of the great stories of American history, many of its heroes were American farmers.
It was a pivotal moment in the War of 1812. At the time, the British Army seemed totally unstoppable. They had just beaten Napoleon in Europe, and set fire to the United States Capitol. But that did not stop a man named General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. Did you ever hear of Andrew Jackson of Tennessee? [Applause] He was a great general and a great President, and his ragtag militia of patriots who were ready to fight to defend American independence.
In December of 1814, Jackson and his Tennessee volunteers had made their way to New Orleans to defend that crucial port from the British. Through grueling winter weeks, horrible weather, icy rain, hunger, and sleepless nights, a few thousand American patriots fought to hold back a British force nearly twice as large and that everybody thought was totally unstoppable.
Finally, on this day, 203 years ago, the British launched their full-scale attack, and it was brutal. It was brutal. They expected to secure swift victory and seize control of the Mississippi River. And that would have been catastrophic for what we were doing.
It was not the first time the British had underestimated the American spirit. Do you notice how so many people underestimate the Americans? They're not underestimating us so much anymore, folks. [Applause]
But Jackson's men quickly proved them very, very wrong. Within only one half an hour, an outnumbered force -- the American force -- achieved victory over one of the world's mightiest empires and one of the strongest armies ever seen. Tennessee -- congratulations, Tennessee. [Applause] I like you too. I like you too, Tennessee.
The Americans held their ground. Independence was secured. Andrew Jackson's name was etched into history. And those patriot farmers proved once again that, in the words of Andrew Jackson, farmers are the ""basis of society
Today, the Battle of New Orleans lives on in the American soul, and it lives on in each and every one of you. Our task is to preserve the freedom that American soldiers have fought for and died for in every generation. Our task is to uphold the values and principles that define who we are as a nation and as a people. Our task is to love, cherish, and protect the flag and the Constitution of the United States.
If we do these things, if we reawaken the confidence that inspired Jackson's victory -- our country is getting its confidence back again -- the character that stormed the beaches of Normandy, and the courage that sent pilgrims across the ocean and astronauts to the moon, then there is nothing we can't do. [Applause]
For America, there is no task too great, no goal too large, no dream beyond our reach. We are witnessing a new era of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. And at the forefront of this exciting new chapter is the great American farmer. Thank you. [Applause]
A phrase that I've heard all my life, but I will repeat right now -- very simple, but very, very accurate and concise: Farm country is God's country. So true. [Applause]
Thank you very much, Tennessee. And thank you for the honor of speaking here this afternoon. I'm thrilled to stand with you today, and I will be standing with you for many years to come. Together, we truly are making America great again. God bless you. God bless everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause. The President moves to a signing table on the podium]
Streamlining and expediting requests to locate broadband facilities in rural America. [Applause, the executive order is signed] Might as well be efficient. We'll do the other one while I'm here. Nice job in putting a mic at that table, folks. [Laughter]
Supporting broadband tower facilities in rural America and federal properties managed by the Department of the Interior. Those towers are going to go up, and you're going to have great, great broadband. Thank you. [Applause, the memorandum is signed] Thank you, everybody."
2017-12-30,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Palm Beach, FL","Palm Beach, FL, United States","[-80.0364297, 26.7056206]",donald-trump-weekly-address-december-30-2017,"My fellow Americans. As we approach the final days of the year, it is truly incredible to think of how much we have accomplished on our journey together.
Since theÂ electionÂ we have created more than 2 million jobs for hardworking, wonderful families, and wonderful Americans. Unemployment is at a 17-year low. The stock market is at an all-timeÂ high,Â and continues to go up, up, up. We want to keep it going.
We've liberated the American economy from the Washington overreach, cutting 22 regulations for every one new regulation, the most in the history of our country by far. And just last week, we delivered a big beautiful Christmas present to the American people.
Congress passed massive tax cuts for millions ofÂ workingÂ American families and small businesses and large businesses, and those large businesses, in particular, coupled with others, are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs.
Our tax plan is focused on the middle class, including a near doubling of the standard deduction and a huge increase in the child tax credit. A typical family of four earning $75,000, will see their tax bill cut in half -- one-half -- of what you are paying, and Americans will begin seeing these tax cuts in their paychecks starting in February.
In addition, our border is now strong. We'll be building the wall. Your Second Amendment is safe. We're unlocking America's vast energy resources. We've restored enforcement of immigration laws, taken the fight right to MS-13 and getting them out of the country, and we are now working with Congress to end chain migration and the Visa Lottery Program, which isÂ terrible,Â and brings in people that we don't want in our country.
I'm very proud of the choice of Justice Neal Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and we are reshaping the entire judiciary for many decades to come.
Congress has authorized funding for our military at near-recordÂ levels,Â so that we can rebuild our full military might after years of dangerous cuts and depletion of our military.
We've made historic strides in the fight against the murderous terror group known as ISIS. Today, the coalition to defeat ISIS has recaptured nearly 100 percent of the territory once held by these vile terrorists in Iraq and Syria.
We are rebuilding our nation, rebuilding our confidence, and rebuilding our standing in the world. Today, the entire world can see that America is coming back and coming back strong. The American people are excited about the future, and the incredible possibilities that await all of us.
Optimism is everywhere, enthusiasm is booming, and the thrilling American adventure has never looked brighter. We are facing all challenges with new solutions, and we are seizing new opportunities with brimming confidence and boundless resolve.
Because of you, your patriotism, your devotion, your love for your family, we will be able to pass on the blessings of American liberty and prosperity to our children, and our grandchildren. Together, we are protecting our magnificent heritage and reaching forÂ glorious destiny.
Finally, Melania and I want to wish every American a very Happy New Year. Our country is great. Our country is strong. We're doing things that nobody thought possible. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help. God bless you and God bless America."
2017-12-18,Speech: Donald Trump Delivers a Speech on National Security Policy,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-national-security-december-18-2017,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Please. I want to thank Vice President Pence, along with the many members of my Cabinet here with us today. I also want to thank all of the dedicated professionals -- military, civilian, and law enforcement -- who devote their lives to serving our nation. In particular, I want to recognize General Dunford and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause]
In addition, we are honored to be joined by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
Let me begin by expressing our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers for the victims of the train derailment in Washington State. We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities. It is all the more reason why we must start immediately fixing the infrastructure of the United States.
We're here today to discuss matters of vital importance to us all: America's security, prosperity, and standing in the world. I want to talk about where we've been, where we are now, and, finally, our strategy for where we are going in the years ahead.
Over the past 11 months, I have traveled tens of thousands of miles to visit 13 countries. I have met with more than 100 world leaders. I have carried America's message to a grand hall in Saudi Arabia, a great square in Warsaw, to the General Assembly of the United Nations, and to the seat of democracy on the Korean Peninsula. Everywhere I traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the American people.
Throughout our history, the American people have always been the true source of American greatness. Our people have promoted our culture and promoted our values. Americans have fought and sacrificed on the battlefields all over the world. We have liberated captive nations, transformed former enemies into the best of friends, and lifted entire regions of the planet from poverty to prosperity.
Because of our people, America has been among the greatest forces for peace and justice in the history of the world. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise.
When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. On November 8, 2016, you voted to make America great again. [Applause] You embraced new leadership and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope. That is why we are here today.
But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. For many years, our citizens watched as Washington politicians presided over one disappointment after another. To many of our leaders -- so many who forgot whose voices they were to respect and whose interests they were supposed to defend -- our leaders in Washington negotiated disastrous trade deals that brought massive profits to many foreign nations, but sent thousands of American factories, and millions of American jobs, to those other countries.
Our leaders engaged in nation-building abroad, while they failed to build up and replenish our nation at home. They undercut and shortchanged our men and women in uniform with inadequate resources, unstable funding, and unclear missions. They failed to insist that our often very wealthy allies pay their fair share for defense, putting a massive and unfair burden on the U.S. taxpayer and our great U.S. military.
They neglected a nuclear menace in North Korea; made a disastrous, weak, and incomprehensibly bad deal with Iran; and allowed terrorists such as ISIS to gain control of vast parts of territory all across the Middle East.
They put American energy under lock and key. They imposed punishing regulations and crippling taxes. They surrendered our sovereignty to foreign bureaucrats in faraway and distant capitals.
And over the profound objections of the American people, our politicians left our borders wide open. Millions of immigrants entered illegally. Millions more were admitted into our country without the proper vetting needed to protect our security and our economy.
Leaders in Washington imposed on the country an immigration policy that Americans never voted for, never asked for, and never approved -- a policy where the wrong people are allowed into our country and the right people are rejected. American citizens, as usual, have been left to bear the cost and to pick up the tab.
On top of everything else, our leaders drifted from American principles. They lost sight of America's destiny. And they lost their belief in American greatness. As a result, our citizens lost something as well. The people lost confidence in their government and, eventually, even lost confidence in their future.
But last year, all of that began to change. The American people rejected the failures of the past. You rediscovered your voice and reclaimed ownership of this nation and its destiny.
On January 20th, 2017, I stood on the steps of the Capitol to herald the day the people became the rulers of their nation again. [Applause] Thank you. Now, less than one year later, I am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has already seen the signs. America is coming back, and America is coming back strong.
Upon my inauguration, I announced that the United States would return to a simple principle: The first duty of our government is to serve its citizens, many of whom have been forgotten. But they are not forgotten anymore. With every decision and every action, we are now putting America first.
We are rebuilding our nation, our confidence, and our standing in the world. We have moved swiftly to confront our challenges, and we have confronted them head-on.
We are once again investing in our defense -- almost $700 billion, a record, this coming year. We are demanding extraordinary strength, which will hopefully lead to long and extraordinary peace. We are giving our courageous military men and women the support they need and so dearly deserve.
We have withdrawn the United States from job-killing deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the very expensive and unfair Paris Climate Accord. And on our trip to Asia last month, I announced that we will no longer tolerate trading abuse.
We have established strict new vetting procedures to keep terrorists out of the United States, and our vetting is getting tougher each month.
To counter Iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, I sanctioned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support of terrorism, and I declined to certify the Iran Deal to Congress.
Following my trip to the Middle East, the Gulf states and other Muslim-majority nations joined together to fight radical Islamist ideology and terrorist financing. We have dealt ISIS one devastating defeat after another.
The coalition to defeat ISIS has now recaptured almost 100 percent of the land once held by these terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Great job. [Applause] Great job. Really good. Thank you. Thank you. We have a great military. We're now chasing them wherever they flee, and we will not let them into the United States.
In Afghanistan, our troops are no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies of our plans. We are beginning to see results on the battlefield. And we have made clear to Pakistan that while we desire continued partnership, we must see decisive action against terrorist groups operating on their territory. And we make massive payments every year to Pakistan. They have to help.
Our efforts to strengthen the NATO Alliance set the stage for significant increases in member contributions, with tens of billions of dollars more pouring in because I would not allow member states to be delinquent in the payment while we guarantee their safety and are willing to fight wars for them.
We have made clear that countries that are immensely wealthy should reimburse the United States for the cost of defending them. This is a major departure from the past, but a fair and necessary one -- necessary for our country, necessary for our taxpayer, necessary for our own thought process.
Our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime has resulted in the toughest-ever sanctions. We have united our allies in an unprecedented effort to isolate North Korea. However, there is much more work to do. America and its allies will take all necessary steps to achieve a denuclearization and ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world. [Applause]
Thank you. This situation should have been taken care of long before I got into office, when it was much easier to handle. But it will be taken care of. We have no choice.
At home, we are keeping our promises and liberating the American economy. We have created more than 2 million jobs since the election. Unemployment is at a 17-year-low. The stock market is at an all-time high and, just a little while ago, hit yet another all-time high -- the 85th time since my election. [Applause]
We have cut 22 regulations for every one new regulation, the most in the history of our country. We have unlocked America's vast energy resources.
As the world watches -- and the world is indeed watching -- we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for American families and businesses. It will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And we are seeing the response we fully expected. Economic growth has topped 3 percent for two quarters in a row. GDP growth, which is way ahead of schedule under my administration, will be one of America's truly greatest weapons.
Optimism has surged. Confidence has returned. With this new confidence, we are also bringing back clarity to our thinking. We are reasserting these fundamental truths:
A nation without borders is not a nation. [Applause] A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot protect its interests abroad. A nation that is not prepared to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. A nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident in its future. And a nation that is not certain of its values cannot summon the will to defend them.
Today, grounded in these truths, we are presenting to the world our new National Security Strategy. Based on my direction, this document has been in development for over a year. It has the endorsement of my entire Cabinet. Our new strategy is based on a principled realism, guided by our vital national interests, and rooted in our timeless values.
This strategy recognizes that, whether we like it or not, we are engaged in a new era of competition. We accept that vigorous military, economic, and political contests are now playing out all around the world.
We face rogue regimes that threaten the United States and our allies. We face terrorist organizations, transnational criminal networks, and others who spread violence and evil around the globe.
We also face rival powers, Russia and China, that seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth. We will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest.
As an example, yesterday I received a call from President Putin of Russia thanking our country for the intelligence that our CIA was able to provide them concerning a major terrorist attack planned in St. Petersburg, where many people, perhaps in the thousands, could have been killed. They were able to apprehend these terrorists before the event, with no loss of life. And that's a great thing, and the way it's supposed to work. That is the way it's supposed to work.
But while we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves, and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We know that American success is not a forgone conclusion. It must be earned and it must be won. Our rivals are tough, they're tenacious, and committed to the long term. But so are we. To succeed, we must integrate every dimension of our national strength, and we must compete with every instrument of our national power.
Under the Trump administration, America is gaining wealth, leading to enhanced power -- faster than anyone thought -- with $6 trillion more in the stock market alone since the election -- $6 trillion. With the strategy I am announcing today, we are declaring that America is in the game and America is going to win. [Applause] Thank you.
Our strategy advances four vital national interests. First, we must protect the American people, the homeland, and our great American way of life. This strategy recognizes that we cannot secure our nation if we do not secure our borders.
So for the first time ever, American strategy now includes a serious plan to defend our homeland. It calls for the construction of a wall on our southern border; ending chain migration and the horrible visa and lottery programs; closing loopholes that undermine enforcement; and strongly supporting our Border Patrol agents, ICE officers, and Homeland Security personnel. [Applause]
In addition, our strategy calls for us to confront, discredit, and defeat radical Islamic terrorism and ideology and to prevent it from spreading into the United States. And we will develop new ways to counter those who use new domains, such as cyber and social media, to attack our nation or threaten our society.
The second pillar of our strategy is to promote American prosperity. For the first time, American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. Economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for American power and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both.
That is why this National Security Strategy emphasizes, more than any before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our nation for a long, long time to come.
It calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. It calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. It calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. And it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base.
The strategy proposes a complete rebuilding of American infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, airports, waterways, and communications infrastructure. And it embraces a future of American energy dominance and self-sufficiency.
The third pillar of our strategy is to preserve peace through strength. [Applause] We recognize that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unrivaled power is the most certain means of defense. For this reason, our strategy breaks from the damaging defense sequester. We're going to get rid of that. [Applause]
It calls for a total modernization of our military, and reversing previous decisions to shrink our armed forces -- even as threats to national security grew. It calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs.
This strategy includes plans to counter modern threats, such as cyber and electromagnetic attacks. It recognizes space as a competitive domain and calls for multi-layered missile defense. [Applause] This strategy outlines important steps to address new forms of conflict such as economic and political aggression.
And our strategy emphasizes strengthening alliances to cope with these threats. It recognizes that our strength is magnified by allies who share principles -- and our principles -- and shoulder their fair share of responsibility for our common security. Fourth and finally, our strategy is to advance American influence in the world, but this begins with building up our wealth and power at home.
America will lead again. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but we will champion the values without apology. We want strong alliances and partnerships based on cooperation and reciprocity. We will make new partnerships with those who share our goals, and make common interests into a common cause. We will not allow inflexible ideology to become an obsolete and obstacle to peace.
We will pursue the vision we have carried around the world over this past year -- a vision of strong, sovereign, and independent nations that respect their citizens and respect their neighbors; nations that thrive in commerce and cooperation, rooted in their histories and branching out toward their destinies.
That is the future we wish for this world, and that is the future we seek in America. [Applause] With this strategy, we are calling for a great reawakening of America, a resurgence of confidence, and a rebirth of patriotism, prosperity, and pride.
And we are returning to the wisdom of our founders. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. What we have built here in America is precious and unique. In all of history, never before has freedom reigned, the rule of law prevailed, and the people thrived as we have here for nearly 250 years.
We must love and defend it. We must guard it with vigilance and spirit, and, if necessary, like so many before us, with our very lives. And we declare that our will is renewed, our future is regained, and our dreams are restored.
Every American has a role to play in this grand national effort. And today, I invite every citizen to take their part in our vital mission. Together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate American greatness as a shining example to the world. As long as we are proud -- and very proud -- of who we are, how we got here, and what we are fighting for to preserve, we will not fail.
If we do all of this, if we rediscover our resolve and commit ourselves to compete and win again, then together we will leave our children and our grandchildren a nation that is stronger, better, freer, prouder, and, yes, an America that is greater than ever before. God Bless You. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-12-16,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-december-16-2017,"My fellow Americans. This week I signed the National Defense Authorization Act, a historic step forward to rebuild our military. Now it is critical for Congress to pass the clean government appropriations bill that fully funds our military needs.
We must not play politics with our troops. We should pass a clean funding bill and leave the politics aside. We must protect our nation.
I'd also like to take a moment today to discuss our immigration system and how we can reform it to make it work for everyday Americans. Our current immigration system helps special interests, but hurts American workers, taxpayers, and national security.
For decades, now, U.S. immigration rules have been based on an outdated system known as chain migration. Under chain migration, foreign nationals can come to the United States and bring in unlimited numbers of foreign relatives.
A single immigrant can begin a chain that could ultimately bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations. Because these individuals are admitted solely on the basis of family ties, not skill or not merit, most of this immigration is lower-skilled, putting great strain on federal welfare, and because there is no real selection criteria, the current system is totally incompatible with national security.
This week, a terrorist exploded a pipe bomb on a busy subway passage during rush hour in New York City, injuring innocent Americans. This individual arrived through chain migration.
In October, and other terrorists drove a truck into pedestrians and cyclists in New York City, killing eight people and wounding many others. That individual came through a visa lottery.
It is time to create a merit-based immigration system that makes sense for a modern economy, selecting new arrivals based on their ability to support themselves financially and to make positive contributions to U.S. society.
Base it on love of our country. We want people that come in that can love our country. This process begins with Congress passing a bill to end chain migration, and also end the visa lottery.
I have called on Congress to do exactly that. Ending chain migration and also ending the visa lottery, will allow us to have common-sense immigration rules that promote assimilation and wage growth.
It also promotes, most importantly, safety. It will help Americans, both old and new, to thrive, flourish and prosper. Thank you, and God bless America."
2017-12-09,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-december-9-2017,"Help me Dad. Those were the last words spoken by Kate Steinle as she lay dying on a San Francisco pier, a precious young American woman killed in the prime of her life. Kate's death is a tragedy that was entirely preventable. She was shot by an illegal alien and a seven-time convicted felon who had been deported five times. But he was free to harm an innocent American because our leaders refused to protect our border, and because San Francisco is a sanctuary city.
In Sanctuary states and cities, innocent Americans are at the mercy of criminal aliens because state and local officials defy federal authority and obstruct the enforcement of our immigration laws.
Last week in a final injustice, Kate's killer was acquitted on all of most serious charges, yet one more reason why Americans are so upset by sanctuary cities and open border politicians who shield criminal aliens from federal law enforcement, and all of the problems involved with the whole concept of a sanctuary city. They're no good.
We mourn for all of the American families of all backgrounds who will have any empty seat at Christmas this year because our immigration laws were not enforced. No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country.
Our cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration and crack down on sanctuary cities, now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the government, holding troop funding hostage and putting our national security at risk. We cannot allow it.
Every Senator and Congressman will have to make a choice: do they want to protect American citizens, or do they want to protect criminal aliens? Reasonable people can disagree on many things, but there can be no disagreement that the first duty of government is to serve, protect, and defend American citizens.
People can have different views on the technical details of budget policy or transportation. But no one who serves in elected office should disagree that our highest priority must be the safety and well-being of our nation's citizens. Thank you."

Thank you. [Applause, Crowd chants USA] Thank you, everybody. Thank you. And if you think this crowd is big, you should see right now what's outside. Congratulations. [Applause]
Hello, Pensacola. What a place. Right here on the Emerald Coast, right? The Emerald Coast in the great state of Florida where we had a tremendous victory, didn't we? Come on. [Applause]
We are joined by many, many people in the military and great American patriots. Thank you very much. [Applause] When you remember the campaign, I said, let me begin by wishing each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. Right? [Applause] And I can think of no better Christmas present for the American people than giving you a massive tax cut. That is what's happening. [Applause]
And your Senate and your House hopefully very shorty will have those approvals. Those heads will go up and you will be paying a lot less tax. So, congratulations. I hope. They got to vote and I think they will. I can't wait to sign that tax cut great for so many. But great for the middle class. We're going to put it into law. We're going to cap off an incredible first year in office.
There has been no first year like this. Or at least just about -- no, I think the answer is no. But I have to be very accurate because of the fake news back there. [Applause, Crowd Chants Trump]
Thank you. In our campaign for the presidency, we defied the pundits, the politicians, and the special interests because ours was a movement of the people and it really was. It was a movement of you. It was a movement of the people. It was a movement to make America great again. It's happening. It's happening. And by the way, how are your 401(k)s doing? Not too bad, right? [Applause]
Over the weekend, I was in New York City. And I love to say hello to our folks in uniform whether it's the military, whether it's law enforcement. And we had people backstage and I always want to take my time. And a man comes up. He was a police officer in New York City. The first time anyone said this to me. He said, Mr. President, I want to thank you. My family thinks I'm a financial genius. My 401(k) is up 39 percent in nine months. [Applause]
I think it's going to be very hard for somebody to beat us in a few years. Can you imagine now? We are only talking about a few years. All you have to say is, with us it goes up with them, it goes down and that's the end of the election. Right? [Applause]
Everyone is doing well and it's going to be a lot better. We are going to do better and better. We are going to make our country great again. And we are looking at our country now as America first. America first. [Crowd Chants USA] So tonight we are going to speak straight to the American people and cut right through the fake news media. Right through. Right through. [Applause]
Right through. We're going to speak the plain truth and really the truth that you just want to hear. You have to hear. They don't want to hear. But, and by the way, did you see all the corrections the media has been making? They're saying sorry, we made -- they have been doing that all year. They never apologize.
Maybe that comes with being the President. I don't know. They have been apologizing left and right. They took this fraudster from ABC. They suspended him for a month. They should have fired him for what he wrote. [Applause]
He drove the stock market down 350 points in minutes which, by the way, tells you they really like me, right? When you think of it. And you know what he cost people? And I said to everybody, get yourself a lawyer and sue ABC News. Sue them. [Applause]
And then CNN apologized just a little while ago. They apologized, oh thank you CNN, thank you so much. You should have been apologizing for the last two years. [Applause]
True. What a group. What a group. But since the election and then I am going to argue with this. We created 2.2 million new jobs. Factories are coming back to our country. You know we have factories pouring back into our country? Did you ever think you would hear that? I used to tell you that's going to happen. See now there is consequences when companies close up their factories and move to another country, make a product and sell it right through.
They have consequences now. And by the way those consequences are getting very steep. And they are going up. There is no more of that stuff. There is no more. In November alone, you saw this today we added 228,000 jobs. I watched these anchors they were devastated. Oh, what's going on? And honestly we have a long way to go. We are going to do much better than this and I have been saying it.
Including another 33,000 new jobs in manufacturing. You hear that, right? Hispanic unemployment is the lowest ever recorded. Any Hispanics here? Any Hispanics? Any Hispanics? You guys were great. Remember? They weren't going to vote for me because, I'm going to build the wall but they want the wall, too. They want security. [Applause, Crowd chants Build That Wall] Oh, we're going to have the wall. Don't worry.
They want security. How about the Cuban population in Miami? Well, we have Cubans here tonight, good. Was the number 86 percent in favor of Trump? A tremendous percentage. Total unemployment is now at a 17-year low. Think of that. Not bad. Not bad after 10 months. It's only going to get better. Listen to this one. This is to me maybe the most important because it's all psychological to a large extent and that's what creates great news. Consumer confidence is at 17-year high. Think of that.
It was not like that in your last administration. Economic growth last quarter surged to 3.3 percent. You know it. You know where it was, right? When we started, you know where it was? Bingo. 3.3 percent and it's going a lot higher. You know, I used to hear you will never hit three. You will never hit 2.5. You figure maybe 2.3, 2.4. If we didn't have the hurricanes last quarter, we would have hit four percent and everybody back there would have said that's impossible.
We had a little -- couple of hurricanes. You heard about it, right? You heard about it? The stock market is hitting an all-time high record for another -- and think of this. Eighty six times since Election Day, 86 times. [Applause]
It hit a record. Eighty six times. And we're going to keep it going. And then you look at all of the money you folks are making. Oh, I wish I could take 10 or 15 percent. But I think you are not going to do that. But it's getting bigger and bigger. Your pensions are getting bigger and bigger. Your pension funds, all of those things are happening. And wait until you see what we're doing. Tax cuts.
But wait until you see what we are doing with healthcare. Wait until you see. You're going to be happy. Not the ObamaCare nightmare. Not ObamaCare nightmare. It's not that nightmare where your premiums are a disaster, right? They are a disaster.
Now we have it going you watch we have some very good things happening with respect to healthcare. And the taxes are a part of it. And you will see what happens right after taxes, you will going to see what happens. Because with taxes something great is going to get announced. We're getting rid of the individual mandate. That individual mandate. [Applause]
Where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not having to have insurance or healthcare. So you pay for the privilege of not getting taken care of. Isn't that a wonderful thing? And we're going to repeal it. [Applause]
Since the election, we have created more than $5 trillion in new economic wealth just in the stock market alone. We are not including real estate and other values, $5 trillion. And we are finally rebuilding our country, defending our citizens and fighting for our great American workers. [Applause]
We're putting America first by renegotiating trade deals. We are renegotiating NAFTA. We are renegotiating our horrendous deal with South Korea. I kept you out of the TPP which would have been a total disaster for you and for everybody else. And we're making individual deals with these countries. You know, when you get tied into 12 countries or 22 countries or 18 countries, you are stuck.
It's a spider web. It's like this. If you have 16 good ones and two bad ones as an example, you can't do it. You can't get out. When you have a deal one-on-one. Nice simple deal. We have a deal with Japan or we have a deal with South Korea or we have a deal with whoever it may be if they don't treat us right, we send them what's called a letter of termination. [Applause] These people always say, oh TPP. You have all these countries tied. And you can't terminate. You are tied into all the good ones. [Audience Member calls out]
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. So, you can't do what you have to do. So you send out a letter of termination. You give them a 60- day notice or a 30-day notice or even a six month notice. They then come back because we're the big piggy bank that everybody likes robbing. The whole world robs it. So they then come back and they say, can we negotiate? Can we make a better deal than we had in the first place, right?
But you can't do that when you have many countries tied in. You can't -- I call it a spider's web. There is a lot of Washington lobbyists, bureaucrats, politicians who don't want to see things changed. They have made fortune. Areas around Washington, D.C. are the richest areas in this country. You saw it the other night. A list came out. We have five areas that are among the richest areas in the country.
That's because everybody is making a fortune and people outside of that area are paying for the money they are making we're not going to have it. They like things the way things used to be. They don't like it so much now. Although, I must tell you they are doing well also. They're doing well also. Their stocks are going up. I don't know if there is anything I can do to prevent it for those people. But they call themselves the resistance. Do you ever see these signs resist. Resist. [Applause]
I love these guys. Look at these guys, blacks for Trump. I love you. I love you. I love you. [Applause] By the way, now that you bring it up black home ownership just hit the highest level it's ever been in the history of our country. Congratulations. [Applause] Oh, these resisters resist. Hillary resisted and do you know what happened? She lost the election in a landslide. [Applause]
But you know what they are really resisting? They are resisting the will of the American people. That's what they are resisting. [Crowd Chants Lock Her Up]
Look, it's being proven we have a rigged system. It doesn't happen so easy. But this system, there will be a lot of changes. This is a rigged - - this is a rigged system. This is a sick system from the inside.
And, you know, there is no country like our country but we have a lot of sickness in some of our institutions and we're working very hard. We have a lot of them straightened out. But we do have, we really do. We have a rigged system in this country that we have to change it. Terrible. Terrible.
They are resisting progress. They're resisting change. Because the only thing they really care about is protecting what they have been able to do, which is really control the country and not to your benefit. By the way, wages starting to go up. First time in 20 years starting to go up. That's all going to happen. That's all going to happen. [Applause]
That's all going to happen. That's just a part of what's going on. But I am going to do something better than that. We are going to have choice. Now, we have choice in education now. We are starting that. Right? And I thought of it the other day. We're going to have choice in jobs so that you don't have one job and hang on even though you don't like it.
You can have choice where can you take five jobs, six jobs, seven jobs, pick the one you like at the most money. That's what is starting to happen because the jobs are coming in. That's what is starting to happen.
Thanks to General Mattis and the military leaders and the allies. Mad Dog. Mad Dog Mattis. [Applause] Mad Dog Mattis. Thanks to Mad Dog Mattis that we have great military leaders. ISIS is being dealt one brutal defeat after another. You see it. Not only are we defeating these killers, these savage killers, horrible, horrible, you don't even want to say people. These are savage killers. Over there but we sure as hell don't want them to come over here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Applause]
You know, they come back to some countries and they come in. We are making it a very difficult process. We had such weakness. They go out, kill people. And then they come back and they go back home to mom and dad. Okay? Before they went nutso and start over here, we are making it very difficult. You see what's being happens. We are watching every single one.
We have thousands of people right now under surveillance. Surveillance. That sounds familiar. That sounds familiar. Remember what I suggested something like that everyone said Trump, why does he say? Well, it turns out I was right about that one, wasn't I? [Applause]
America is being respected again abroad and we are taking care of our citizens at home. And we're going to have safety. And we have got a lot more now. We are getting rid of the M.S. 13 animals. [Applause]
We're going to have safety again. Because America is more than just a place on a map. America is a nation, America is a family. America is ours to love and to cherish and to protect and to take care of and that's what we're doing, we're going to take care of this country for our children and our grandchildren and our great grandchildren. And we're not going to let people come in to our country who are going to destroy our country. [Crowd Chants USA]
And that may or may not be politically correct. But honestly, I don't care. We have to do the right thing. We have to do the right thing. [Applause] Our agenda is pro-family, pro-police, pro-worker, and 100 percent pro- American. [Applause]
That's why I recently withdrew the United States from the United Nations plan for global governance of immigration and refugee policy. No borders. They have a plan, no borders. I heard about it recently. I said, what are you talking about, no borders? No borders. No borders. Everybody can come in. If you don't mind, I rejected that plan. Is that okay? [Applause]
I told them not only do we want no borders. We want the strongest borders you have ever seen. We're going to have such borders. We'll have borders on top of borders. American is a sovereign country. We set our immigration rules. We don't listen to foreign bureaucrats. We don't listen to other countries telling us how we should be running our immigration. Thank you very much. [Applause] We're also getting smart and tough on trade. I have been talking about this for a long time. It's one of the reasons I'm here. One of the reasons I'm president. We are renegotiating the disastrous trade agreements of NAFTA, of South Korea, of so many others. We are making great deals. We're going to hopefully keep NAFTA but there is a chance we won't. And that's okay. That's okay. How many factories have left for Mexico? How many factories? [Crowd responds Too Many]
So we right now have a trade deficit with Mexico of $71 billion and that doesn't include all the drugs that pour in over the border because we don't have a wall, et cetera. Okay? $71 billion. Seventy one billion. So, we have, think of it, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $71 billion. We have a pretty good trade deficit with Canada. They were saying, we have a surplus with Canada.
I said, no, and I like the prime minister very much. Prime Minister Trudeau, nice guy. Good guy. No, I like him. But we had a meeting. He said no, no. You have a trade surplus. I said no, we don't. He said no, no, you have a trade surplus. I said, Mr. Prime Minister, we do not. He said how, do you know? I said, because we don't have a surplus with anybody. We have the worst deals. He said I'm telling you that Canada has a deficit with the United States. I told my people, in front of a lot of people.
I said, go out and check. And he was right except he forgot two categories, lumber, timber and energy. Other than that, he was right. When you add them all together, we actually have a $71 billion deficit with Canada. Right? So, he forgot a couple of categories that he didn't want to mention. I heard it with other countries too. I just got back from Asia. I brought back $300 billion worth of deals. Worth of deals. [Applause]
And that number is going to go a lot higher. And these are numbers that are going to produce a lot of jobs in our country. And that's what we have to be doing. We are going to end the theft of American intellectual property, crack down on China's trade abuses, and confront countries that cheat, of which many of them are in that category sadly.
We will buy back our country. We will take back our country. We will make those great trade deals and we will have unbelievable amounts of jobs created and factories created. [Applause]
And we will do what other countries do. We will start buying American. We want to buy our product. And we will start hiring American. And we will say American and be proud of it and that's what's happening more and more. That's why I see all those red hats and those white hats. I love those hats. [Applause]
That is why one of my very first acts as president was to withdraw the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. Had to do it. We have also cancelled the one job killing regulation that you see after another. One after another, beating the mark of any previous president.
Now, we have -- there was a great article in the ""Wall Street Journal"""" the other day
You know who was right up there? Honest Abe Lincoln. Can you believe it? [Applause] He was a regulation cutter. Can you believe it? Abe Lincoln was a regulation cutter. Who would've known that?
I said, you mean I beat Abraham Lincoln? That's pretty good for 10 months. I don't know if regulations sound so glamorous but tell you it's very important. But we have a lot of others. We have statutory requirements where you have to give a 90-day notice and then another 90-day notice, then you have a cooling-off period then you have to give a 30-day notice. They're all in the works.
And you going to see a lot more cutting of regulations. But we've done more than any other president and it's not even close - and we haven't even started. And as promised - and I used to come out here - I've been here three times - I love it. I just keep coming back. I just keep coming back. [Applause] Oh boy, oh boy. I'll tell you. When we were doing well during that beautiful election night - when we were doing well all over Florida I said, was the Pensacola area included yet? And they said, no. I said, guess what, we just won that election. [Applause]
Right. And as promised, remember? I announced that I would withdraw America - the United States - from the horrible, for us - good for other countries - it's great for other countries - from the horrible Paris Climate Accord. [Applause] Cost us a fortune.
So, China doesn't start until around 2030, I think. Russia doesn't have to go back to like a recent date. Go back to somewhere in the 1990s which was a high-pollution time. Other countries we end up giving money to. This would've been one of the great catastrophes - and I could come back into the deal at a much better price. They'd love me back in.
I could come back into the Paris Accord - and I like the people. I really like Emmanuel. I like so many of the people involved but I could come back - it's like - I don't get it. I don't see it. I want clean air. I want crystal clear and clean water and I want things that they won't have - and I don't want to pay the kind of numbers that you're talking about.
If we stayed with those numbers, we would have had to close factories and businesses in order to qualify by 2025. Can you imagine, ladies and gentlemen, we're violating the accord. In the meantime, some of those countries are spewing stuff out that you wouldn't believe - and we would be closing up. Now we could maybe change the deal but then we get sued by all the groups that sue. You know in China - they don't see China; nobody sues. With us, they sue.
I approved - immediately thereafter we took office the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline; right? 48,000 jobs. We've lifted the restrictions on American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean beautiful coal of which we have 1000 years of supply and we're putting miners back to work.
Did you see West Virginia? I love West Virginia. West Virginia. I love West Virginia. So, West Virginia people were saying - trouble - coal will never come back. In the meantime, they're buying it in Vietnam from us. The president of Vietnam said, that is the finest coal we've ever purchased. They're buying it from us.
So, West Virginia - the numbers just have - great Governor of West Virginia. The numbers just come out - West Virginia had the biggest percentage increase in GDP of any state in our union except for Texas; it was second. How's that? How's that?
They said, oh coal will never come back. Now we're opening up lines and we're drilling and we're doing all sorts of things. And the windmills are wonderful, but you know what, when the wind doesn't blow they really do cause problems. We have no energy this week - well, hopefully the wind will start blowing pretty soon.
We are pursuing American energy dominance. And by the end of this year we will be totally self-sufficient. we will be major exporters of energy. We will take in massive amounts of money. We will start paying off our $20 trillion in debt. [Applause] My administration is also leading the charge to rebuild our military. Our military, right? [Applause]
We're supporting our troops and their wonderful military families, including those right here in the cradle of Naval aviation, the home of the legendary Blue Angels, people don't realize that. [Applause]
By the way, can those people fly or what? How about Naval Air Station Pensacola? Good place, right? And it's really time. This isn't a Republican thing or Democratic thing or anything. It's time for Democrats in Congress to drop the threats of shutdowns of government and support a clean appropriations bill that fully supports and funds our military. We can't play games anymore. [Applause]
We can't play games. And don't forget, we make the greatest missiles, the greatest military equipment anywhere in the world. Nobody is close. And what does it also mean? And to me it's secondary in this case, but what does it also mean? Jobs, jobs.
But we are building our military stronger and by the time I decide to go off into the wild blue yonder, you're going to have the strongest military this country has ever had by far. [Applause]
It's wrong and dangerous for congressional Democrats to hold troop funding hostage for amnesty, letting people pour into our country, we don't know who they are. We don't know where they come from. You saw what happened with beautiful Kate Steinle. This guy, he said he didn't know it was a gun. Oh, he didn't know. Oh, he didn't know. He didn't know it was a gun. That's his new line.
Do you notice the federal government came in and brought another suit against him, right? [Applause] We'll come after him. That was a total miscarriage of justice. He didn't know it was a gun.
The real changes that we are facing are the drugs and the gangs pouring into our country, the millions of people overstaying their visas, chain migration that cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars, and sanctuary cities that set free violent criminal aliens all over our country and protect them. [Crowd Booing]
People come in and they are not necessarily good like the man that ran over -- the animal that ran over many people in New York City the other day. You saw that, two months ago. He runs over people. Goes on a beautiful -- I know it so well, the West Side Highway. I know it so well. So beautiful. People running, jogging, trying to get in shape.
He killed many people, ran them over. Chain migration. According to chain migration, he may have as many as 22 to 24 people that came in with him, his grandfather, his grandmother, his mother, his father, his brothers, his sisters. We have to end chain migration. We have to end chain migration. [Applause]
I mean, you go to Kate, who was such a beautiful young American woman, killed on a pier in San Francisco in the prime of her life. She was killed by this guy, an illegal alien who had been deported five times and convicted seven times of felonies. I guess they weren't allowed to mention this in court. They weren't allowed to mention.
Don't worry, we're right in there. But he was roaming free to threaten innocent Americans like Kate because of our porous borders and because San Francisco is a sanctuary city. In other words, a city run by politicians who would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens.
I mean, let me give you another example. The city of Chicago, what the hell is going on in Chicago? There are those that say that Afghanistan is safer than Chicago, OK? What is going on? Do you know what's wrong with Chicago? Weak, ineffective politicians, Democrats that don't want to force restrictions.
And don't -- and by the way, Chicago, for those of you that are going to say, guns, guns, Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the United States, OK? Just in case you were thinking about -- you know, they immediately say, oh, you have got to take away -- well, Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the United States.
So we're asking Democrats in Congress to cease their obstruction and do the right thing, end sanctuary cities. [Applause] Stop the carnage. Save the innocent lives. We have also begun the process of building the wall on the southern border. [Applause]
And we are empowering our immigration officers to do their job. And they are doing a great job. ICE and Border Patrol agents are working so hard, and they endorsed us for the election. I say us, because it's really not me, it's us all together, it's us, it's us, we are a group, a big group, a big beautiful group. All you have to do is look around here. [Applause] Just look around [Applause]
I just said just look around, and the first thing I see is that big beautiful merry Christmas sign. I mean, can you believe it? [Applause] Remember I told you two years ago when we started, I said -- and it was summer, but I said, you know, we are going to say merry Christmas, but let me just tell you, the department stores, right, they had the beautiful red walls, they had snowflakes all over the place, they had everything. Only one thing missing, the words merry Christmas. They are using those words again. Do you notice? They are using those words again. [Applause]
But one by one we are finding the illegal alien drug dealers, the gang members, the thieves, the criminals, and the killers preying on our children, preying on everybody, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country or we are putting them in prison. [Applause]
And because our borders now are strong as they should be, and they are going to get much stronger, we will not let these people back in. [Applause] It's time for Congress to adopt a pro-American immigration agenda. Every member of Congress should be asked where they stand on these issues. Blocking funds to sanctuary cities. I don't want to give sanctuary cities money. Passing Kate's law to put repeat offenders behind bars for a long period of time. [Applause]
Increasing the number of ICE officers, who are fantastic, and Border Patrol officers so we can dismantle vile criminal gangs like, as I said, MS-13, animals. [Applause] Ensuring that new immigrants to our country are financially self- sufficient and will not be on welfare the day they come in. [Applause]
And as I said, ending chain migration. We want a system that is merit-based. They come in on merit. They don't come in a lottery system. How about the lottery system, folks? Do you see that? [Crowd Booing]
That's the guy in New York City, the lottery system, where they put names in a bin. You know, you think these countries are legit when they do their lottery system. So what they do, I would say, but more than just saying, they take their worst and they put them in the bin. And then when they pick the lottery, they have the real worst in their hands, oh, here we go. And we end up getting them. No more lottery system. We are going to end that. We have already started the process. [Applause]
We want people coming into our country who love our people, support our economy, and embrace our values. It's time to get our priorities straight.
This guy is screaming, we want Roy Moore. He is right. [Applause] Democrats in Congress want open borders, higher taxes, and government-run health care that doesn't work. Costs a fortune, doesn't work. They are soft on crime. And they want to suffocate our economy with socialist-style regulation. Raise your taxes through the sky, they don't want to vote for our tax cuts because they want the -- they want tax increases.
That's why we need a Republican in the House. We need a Republican in the Senate. We need more of them. [Applause] And by the way, just so I can satisfy this gentleman out there. How many people here are from the great state of Alabama? [Applause]
Whoa. Well, I have to say this, look, I have to. We have to be fair. So did you see what happened today? You know the yearbook? Did you see that? There was a little mistake made. She started writing things in the yearbook. Oh, what are we going to do? Gloria Allred, anytime you see her you know something's going wrong.
We cannot afford -- this country, the future of this country, cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate. We can't afford it, folks. We can't. [Applause]
We can't afford to have a liberal Democrat who is completely controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. We can't do it. Can't do it. [Crowd Booing] His name is Jones and he is their total puppet. And everybody knows it. He will never ever vote for us. We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our make America great again agenda, which involves tough on crime, strong on borders, strong on immigration
We want great people coming into our country. Building the wall. Strengthening our military. Continuing our great fight for our veterans. I love our veterans. [Applause] We -- right? We love our veterans. We want conservative judges like Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. Doing a great job, too. We want people that are going to protect your gun rights, great trade deals instead of the horrible deals. [Applause]
And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. [Applause] Do it. Do it. Do it. Working with Republicans in Congress, we have already signed 88 pieces of legislation. We get no credit. They always say, well, you know -- President Trump really needs this tax bill, because he hasn't passed any legislation.
Well, so far, in 10 months, we've passed more during this period of time than any other President in the history of our country. And the second -- let's call runner-up -- is Harry Truman was second. So we passed all of this, including, including the long-awaited Veterans Accountability Act. You know what that is, right? David Shulkin, our Secretary, has done a great job. The VA was a mess, so many parts of our country...
Hey, they left me with North Korea. They left me with a mess in the Middle East. They left me with Afghanistan, which is -- was a disaster. We make a lot of progress in Afghanistan just like we have with getting ISIS out of Iraq, getting ISIS out of Syria, knocking the hell out of them. They left me with a mess. But we're cleaning up the mess, we're cleaning it up, and with time, we'll have it spinning like a top.
For decades, veterans have asked for a law to hold corrupt and incompetent employees and the VA accountable, but it never happened. Then, we got it done, this piece of legislation... for decades, they wanted it. You couldn't fire anybody at the VA if they were sadists, if they were horrible people, if they wouldn't show up to work, you couldn't fire anybody.
Now, we look at them, they're no good, we say you're fired, get out of here. [Applause] And I must tell you: I can't believe that Arnold Schwarzenegger bombed so badly on The Apprentice. My poor, beautiful, show. It was so successful. We get a big movie star and he can't pull it off.
We are respecting Americans heroes, and rebuilding America's standing. All over the world, they're respecting us again. When I came into office, we inherited all of these problems, all around the globe. Years of America projecting weakness, not going over the red line. If we went over the red line, you wouldn't have had Russia and Iran going into Syria, but you know what? He said: you're never going to do it. Don't ever violate the red line.
They violated the red line. He did nothing. So Russia went in, and Iran went in. But you know what? We had 59 missiles -- and they use gas -- and we said you can't do that and we hit them -- our great military -- from ships 700 miles away, 59 missiles and 59 perfect hits. [Applause]
And we've stopped apologizing for America, and we have started defending the reputation of the United States, finally. [Applause] To prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, I recently declined to certify the disaster known as the Iran nuclear deal, a total disaster. How about that deal? How about that thing?
We give them a $150 billion right? We give them a $150 billion, but here's the thing... smaller money, but think of this. We give them $1.8 billion in cash. I mean, I like green. In fact, it was so much cash, that they had to go to other countries also because we didn't have enough cash in Washington DC. They loaded up planes with cash. Can you believe, the president has that kind of power. I don't want to ever try it. No, but can you believe that the presidency has the power to send bushel loads of cash to Iran, probably for hostages, probably -- $1.8 billion, probably for hostages. So sad, We don't do that. We don't do that anymore.
As part of the campaign of maximum pressure on the vile dictatorship of North Korea, we have imposed the toughest ever sanctions passed by the United Nations Security Council, and we have a lot of other sanctions. But you know, I don't know that sanctions are going to work with him. We got to give it a shot. You know, we'll see.
Who knows? I just tell you folks, you're in good hands. That's all I can say. That's all I can say. [Applause] And I've strengthened our relationships with America's allies, and asked other NATO members to pay their fair share. And now the money is pouring in. The money is pouring in. Remember I went to NATO a year ago and these fake people back here, they were saying Donald Trump's performance at NATO was unacceptable.
You know why? You know why they said it? Because I told the people of NATO standing right behind me, while they were standing behind me, they've been delinquent, they haven't been paying. I said you go ta pay, you gotta pay, you gotta pay. And now they've taken in, because of that -- and I guess I applied if you don't pay we're out of there, right -- and I took more heat from the press. They said: Donald Trump was rude to our allies. Well, they're rude to us when they don't pay, right? [Applause] They're rude to us.
So we'll have a nation that doesn't pay. Then the nation gets frisky with whoever, Russia. So we have a nation doesn't pay. The nation gets aggressive. We end up in World War III for somebody that doesn't even pay. You think they think we're geniuses? So here's what's happened. In the last short period of time, Stoltenberg, who's the the head of NATO, he's my biggest fan in the whole world, because he couldn't get anybody to pay.
We've taken in $11 billion extra, and going into 2020 or 2021, we will have taken in $33 billion extra, and they aren't even doing what they should be doing, just so you understand, it's terrible, the way our country has been disrespected. But we will be disrespected no longer, okay? [Applause]
Now tomorrow morning, you'll see from these fakers back there, Donald Trump again disrespects NATO. I don't disrespect them. I think NATO's wonderful. But you know what, we're paying for. 80% of NATO, could be higher. They say 72%. So we're paying for 80% of NATO. Now I can only tell you one thing: it helps them a hell of a lot more than it helps us, okay?
And they should pay. Germany's paying 1%. We're paying 4%. Explain that one to me, right? And Germany has unsustainable cash flow. I read a report. Ttheir cash flow is unsustainable. So I said to Angela, I said, Angela send a little of that cash flow our way. And she said, but Donald -- because we're protecting them -- we have 40,000 soldiers in Germany. Nobody even knows that. I said, Angela,  let us have some . She said Donald, the German people wouldn't be happy with that. I said, well, you know what the American people aren't happy with the way we have it now, okay? [Applause] The American people aren't happy.
And at home,  we're restoring the rule of law. We're interpreting the Constitution, as written, defending the Second Amendment. You'll keep your guns. And protecting religious liberty. We are protecting religious liberty, and we're getting rid of the Johnson amendment. We've stopped the government's attacks on our Judeo-Christian values, because we know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community. We know that.
Getting rid of the Johnson amendment, study that up. That's a big thing. That's a big thing. A lot of people are very, very happy about that. We know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children, and to nurture their children. [Applause]. And, above all else, we know this, America, doesn't worship, government, we worship God. [Applause]
All of us here tonight are united by the same values. We love our country, and we are proud of our history. We are so proud of this country. We honor our heritage and we treasure our freedom. We support our incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
We believe the United States military is the greatest force for justice in the history of the world, and we are going to take care of it, and we are going to properly fund it, and we are going to have the finest weapons, because when we do all of that we are much, much safer, and far less likely to have to use them. It's amazing how that works, isn't it?
We believe that every American should stand for the national anthem -- [Applause, Crowd chants USA] --  and we proudly pledge allegiance to one nation under God. [Applause] Our rights come from our Creator, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away, and they never will. That is why my administration is taking power back from global bureaucrats and returning that power back to the American people, and you see it all the time. You see it economically, you see it at the church. You see it in every different way.
We don't sing a global anthem, our troops don't wear a foreign uniform and we will never surrender our rights to international tribunals. We won't do that. [Applause] We proudly sing the star-spangled banner. Our brave troops, fight and die for the red, white and blue, and we protect and preserve the American Constitution that we cherish. I've said it so often that my job is not to be President of the world.
My job is to be President of the United States of America. [Applause] Yet there are powerful forces, in Washington, trying to sabotage our movement. These are bad people. These are very, very bad and evil people. They know who they are. These are the people who made their money, their names, their careers, their power off the corrupt and broken system, and they liked it the other way. So they will do anything, at any time, and they'll never stop.
But you know what we're stopping them. You're seeing that right now, you're seeing that right now, we're stopping them. It's corrupt, it's rigged and we're stopping them. They will lie and leak and smear, because they don't want to accept the results of an election where we won by a landslide. Do you remember? There is no way for Donald Trump to get 270.
There, we heard that for week after week -- what they're doing is the fake news, it's called suppression. Just like they give the fake polls, I call it fake news, fake polls. A poll came out today on CNN. Such a fake. A poll came out. They will have to apologize for that one. Another one came out that was through the roof but it wasn't on CNN.
But I will tell you, look, look, we need honesty. We need some love in the country. I would love to bring both sides together if that's possible. There is a lot of hatred out there. But I would love to be able to bring both sides together. [Applause]
But remember this, the same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement right from the beginning are the same people who have undermined the credibility of our government institutions. They are the same ones who gave us one terrible trade deal after another, and one foreign policy blunder and disaster after another, with no accountability and no apology.
The Washington insiders who oppose our movement are the same people who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, our borders, look at our country, we owe $20 trillion, think of it. We have spent, as of two months ago, almost $7 trillion in the Middle East. And do you know what we have? We have nothing. It's worse than it was 17 years ago when they started.
These are the people that fight us. And if I want to fix up the roads in this country, they say, oh, well, we don't want to spend money for that, it's a tiny fraction. We could have, with that 7 trillion, not billion, $7 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country three times over. They've had their chance at running this country and they failed.
So I think I speak for everyone here tonight, and I appreciate your being here, especially in numbers where you can't even get into the corners, when I proudly say... [Applause]
You know the beautiful thing, I was telling some of my friends backstage, the amazing thing about this and all the people that couldn't get in, when an election is over, they tell me, what do I know? I wasn't - - I have been a politician for a little more than two years. So what do I know? Although I'm doing a good job, I guess, right? I'm president. I'm President. [Applause]
But -- but, it's sort of incredible, you look at everybody, you see everybody, you see the love in the room, and you see what's going on with everything. And you say to yourself, this is truly a country that respects -- they say that when you don't have an election -- the election is over. There is no competition. There is no nothing. Although we always have the deep seats inside.
But, it's over. They say you can't draw a crowd. In other words, when an election ends, you can't draw flies. They say -- look at this place. Look at this place. [Applause]
I will never forget on the trail, I would go, we would have 20,000, 25,000. We went to Mobile, Alabama, we had 49,000 people. [Applause] We went to Michigan the night of the election. I got there, started speaking at 12:30 in the evening. That means it was already Election Day. We had 32,000 people there. Michigan hadn't been won in many, many years by a Republican. Hillary Clinton went there in an emergency because she was told that day that she was doing badly in Michigan.
She went there. She had a crowd of like 600 people. I had 32,000 people at 1:00 in the morning. I said, why are we not going to win? Why are we not going to win? And we won. [Applause] We went to Wisconsin, hasn't been won in many, many years. Do you remember that? We went to Wisconsin, hadn't been won in many, many years. She decided not to go. Thank you very much, Hillary. [Laughter]
I guess the Russians advised her not to go, you know. [Laughter] But she decided not to go. And her husband supposedly said, you better go to Wisconsin. You better go to Michigan, I don't like what I'm seeing, I was in Michigan and I was driving down the street and they have a Trump/Pence sign on every single lawn all the way to the arena, you had better go there. [Applause]
And she said no, no, no, my bunch of dummies -- bunch of dummies. You know, I don't get credit for one thing. It always bothered me. I spent a tiny fraction of what she spent and we won. You know, the old days, if you spend less and you win, that's a good thing. Over here, you don't get any credit for it.
We spent 25 or 30 percent. She was at, what number, 2.2 billion, I understand, 2.2 billion. Do you think -- do you think those consultants made a couple of bucks on that election? Didn't she spend 12.4 million on a dossier that was a total phony, right, 12.4 million? [Crowd Booing] Boy.
So we spent a tiny fraction, think of it, a tiny fraction of the money and we won. But we won because of people like you. [Applause] Because of people like you. And I will tell you what, if the Democrats had won that election, instead of being up 39 points in your 401(k)s, you would be down 50 percent from Election Day, I'm telling you, because it was ready to go down the tubes. I will tell you that. [Crowd calls out]
Thank you, man. So we don't need the advice from the Washington swamp. We need to drain the swamp and we're going to do it and we are doing it. [Applause]
That's why I don't really care about all the bitter attacks, all the phony stuff going on. Big media, special interests, phonies all. They are not here to protect you. They are only here to preserve and to protect themselves. And you are finding that out.
I had a great life before I did this. Oh, think of where I would be right now if I didn't do this, I'd be very happy, believe me. But I wanted to do it, and I wanted to give back, and I saw what was happening, and I've always been good at doing the money thing. I saw what was happening to our country, and it wasn't good. It wasn't good. [Applause]
I took this job on behalf of the forgotten men and women of our country. But guess what? They are forgotten no more. [Applause] No more. People came out of areas -- you know, they didn't think you existed. You know that, right? Remember? And do you remember the word deplorable? How brilliant was that? I was watching her with that speech. And she was reading a teleprompter, yet. And she said ""deplorables."""" And I said
She is talking about a lot of people. Little did I know, I was right. That thing blew up. That was one of the reasons she lost. And now we are all proud deplorables. We're proud deplorables. [Applause]
Very proud. Your voice will never ever be ignored again. They are all going to be coming after you for every election from now on in this country. You will never be ignored again. Your dreams are my dreams. Your hopes are my hopes. And your future is what I am fighting for each and every day. [Applause]
We're just getting started. We're on the verge of passing that wonderful, beautiful tax cut. It's the biggest in the history of our country. It doubles the amount of income taxed at the rate of zero. It lowers tax rate. It expands the child -- you know that, the child tax credit so broadly. It provides relief from the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
It cuts small business taxes. It reduces the corporate rate, very importantly, from 35 percent, which is the highest in the industrialized world, all the way down to 20 percent. You're going to have new companies coming in. You're going to have jobs, jobs, jobs. And it brings corporate money from overseas back where it belongs. And we're talking about possibly in excess of $4 trillion that we can finally bring back.
The typical family of four earning $75,000 will see an income tax cut of up to $2,000 cutting their tax bill in half. People don't know it. And they don't want to report it. These people don't want to report it.
Our business tax cut is expected to raise annual income for the typical household by more than $4,000. They don't want to tell you that. They don't want to tell you that, fake news. Our plan means more companies will move to America, stay in America, and hire in America.
We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job well done. [Applause] The Democrats in Washington want to grow our welfare rolls that you're going to pay for. They want to grow all sorts of things that you don't want to even think about. I want to grow our employment rolls with great jobs, well-paying jobs, jobs of dignity, jobs where people love waking up in the morning and going to work. And that's happening.
So we're going to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We will restore hope to our struggling rural communities and to our inner cities where we are making progress. We are making progress.
We will build new roads and bridges and tunnels and highways all throughout our land. Factories will come roaring back to life. New works of iron and steel will be forged from fire and from spark and from our country. And they will be made with American muscle, American hands, and most importantly, American heart. [Applause]
And these creations will be branded with a very simple but very beautiful phrase, made in the USA. [Applause] We have it in our power to build this future together, a future of patriotism, prosperity and pride. We all share one home and one glorious destiny. And whether we are young or old -- I feel very young, do you feel young? [Applause]
Whether we are from the city or the country, and whether we are black or brown or white, you've heard it before, we all bleed the same red blood. [Applause] We all salute the same great American flag. [Applause] And we are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause] We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two world wars, put a man on the moon, and brought communism to its knees. [Applause]
As long as we have the courage of our convictions, and the strength to see them through, then there is no goal beyond our reach. As long as we are true to our values, loyal to our citizens, and faithful to our God, then we will not fail. [Applause]
This is your land. This is your home. And it's your voice that matters the most. So speak up, be heard, and fight, fight, fight for the change you have been waiting for your entire life, for the change that you already see happening. Our revolution didn't end on November 8th. That was just the beginning. [Applause]
The greatest adventure still lies ahead. Never give in, never give up, never back down, and never ever stop dreaming. [Applause]
Because we are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. So with American pride swelling in our hearts and American courage stirring in our souls, I say these words tonight, together we will, indeed, make America strong again. [Applause]
We will make America proud again. [Applause] We will make America wealthy again. [Applause] We will make America safe again. [Applause] And put it all together and what do we have? We will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you, everybody."
2017-12-02,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-december-2-2017,"Sixty-two years ago this week, a brave seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama, uttered one word that changed history. On the evening of December 1st, 1955, when a bus driver told Rosa Parks to hand over her seat, she looked him in the eye and she told him no. No, she was not going to give up her seat because of her color, or the color of her skin.
Rosa Parks remained strong and stayed in her seat to defend the truth etched into our Declaration of Independence that all of us, regardless of the color of our skin, are created equal by God.
Her courageous act inspired a young Christian pastor, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., along with thousands of others in Montgomery, to join the movement and boycott the city bus service.
After 381 days, the city ordinance was finally overturned. Soon, millions of others across the country joined the civil rights movement, and helped secure the freedom and the equality that is every American's birthright.
Today, our nation is better, our country more just, and our people more united because of the bravery of Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks legacy, continues to inspire our citizens to pursue a better tomorrow, and to build a country where every American child, no matter their skin color, can live without fear, dream without limits and take their rightful place in the great story of our nation.
Thank you. God bless you and God bless America."
2017-11-29,"Speech: Donald Trump on Tax Reform in St. Charles, Missouri","St. Charles, MO, United States","[-90.4974359, 38.7881062]",donald-trump-speech-tax-reform-st-charles-missouri-november-29-2017,"I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right? [Applause] And it's great to be back in Missouri, sign of a lot of good things, because you're doing really well. And I want to thank Governor Greitens, and Attorney General Hawley, who, by the way, Josh -- where's Josh? Josh, our next Senator. Where is he? [Applause]
He's going to be a great Senator, and he wants to see a major tax cut. I think I can speak for him, right? And your current Senator does not want to see a tax cut. That's not good. That's not good. Wants your taxes to go up. Secretary Mnuchin, who's doing such a fantastic job. Thank you.
And Linda McMahon, everybody knows, administrator, small business became a big business under Linda. She's helping a lot of people. Thank you very much, Linda. [Applause]
I especially want to thank Missouri's incredible Congressional delegation. Sam Graves. Where's Sam? You all here? Yeah. They all flew in with me. They wouldn't miss that flight. Vicky Hartzler. Vicky? Thank you. Thank you, Vicky. [Applause]
Billy Long, who I think was my first endorser in the entire country, practically, Billy, right? Thank you, Billy. Blaine Luetkemeyer. Blaine? Thank you, Blaine. And he was great on television today. I watched him. I got up early, and I watched you on -- that was a good interview. Thank you. Very much in favor of tax cuts.
Jason Smith and Ann Wagner. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Ann. And you know, I have two others that -- I have a lot of -- I have a lot of faith in Faith. Sally Faith. Where's Sally, your mayor. Hi, Sally. Thanks, Sally. And Eric Schmitt, Missouri state treasurer. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. You're doing a great job.
Just three months ago, we came to this state to launch our plan to bring back Main Street by cutting taxes for American families and small businesses. Today I've come back to this incredible state to spend an afternoon with it's amazing citizens -- you are amazing -- to help push our plan for historic tax cuts right across that finish line. We're going to do that.
With your help we can usher a thrilling new era of opportunity and growth for this nation that we love so much. Tax cuts have already passed the House of Representatives. [Applause] Big ones.
The eyes of the world now turn to the United States Senate. A successful vote in the Senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the American people. Massive tax cuts and reform -- I don't even mention the word ""reform
You know, for years they have not been able to get tax cuts, many, many years since Reagan. And the problem was, they talked about tax reform, not tax cuts. I said, don't call it reform; call it tax cuts and reform. So every once in awhile we'll add the name ""reform
We cannot sit idly by and watch ourselves losing in competition to other countries as they continue to take away our jobs, because their tax codes are more competitive and less burdensome than ours.
That's why we must cut our taxes, reduce economic burdens and restore America's competitive edge. We're going to do that too, and it's already happening. Look what's happening with our markets. People get it. [Applause]
If we do this, then American will win again like never ever before. [Applause] A vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again. We want to do that. [Applause] We want to put America first again. It's time to take care of our workers, to protect our communities, and to rebuild our great country.
You know, we have spent almost $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 16 years, $7 trillion. Now I'm taking care of it. We're doing numbers like ISIS has never seen before. We're wiping them out, the terrorists. They're bad. [Applause]
And all of that, but we've spent almost $7 trillion. We could have rebuilt our country four times over. And we're going to start spending here. We're going to start spending here. [Applause]
And with that being said, we're going to protect our country, whether it's North Korea or anybody -- we're going to protect our country like never before. We're going to build up our military and make our product here and make our planes and our boats and our everything here. But we're going to build up our military. [Applause]
But we've got to start focusing on our country. That's why I'm saying America first. Make America great again. You've never heard that expression. [Applause]
All those hats. All those -- they've never heard that expression before. That was a good expression, and it is a true expression, and it's already happening, and long ahead of schedule.
In fact today, some numbers came out that people haven't seen in many, many years. This beautiful city of St. Charles is the perfect place to deliver the message that I want to deliver. It's the place where America's past and future come to life on its historic brick- lined Main Street, nice street. Do you agree? [Applause]
It was along these very streets that in 1804, the great American explorers, Lewis and Clark, gathered their final supplies before setting out on their very historic expedition of discovery. I have to say, I didn't really know that until two days ago. [Laughter] Hey? See, now the world is watching. Look at all the fake news back there. They're all... [Applause] They're all watching.
Today, more than two centuries later, a new generation of American pioneers begins its own adventure, gathering inside the startups and the storefronts of Main Streets across the country, blazing new trails into totally uncharted territory of business and technology, and once again, leading our nation into a future of limitless potential. It's what we have in this country. We have the greatest people. It's the greatest country. I love this country so much. [Applause]
Our country was not treated properly for a long time. We're treating it properly. We're treating it with love, and with this. We've got to treat it with this. [Applause] And today, just as it's always been, Main Street is the heart of our economy, the soul of our community, and the birthplace of American dreams.
But over the years, crippling taxes, massive regulation, and totally disastrous trade deals -- oh, the trade deals. Oh, I get a headache thinking about who made these deals, one after another. WTO, NAFTA, the wonderful deal with South Korea. Remember, they said it's going to produce 200,000 jobs -- and it did, for South Korea. Didn't produce -- We lost 200,000. It turned some of our businesses' Main Streets into empty ghost towns. You see what's happened.
Now, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore American prosperity, and reclaim America's great destiny. We've already made tremendous progress; far greater than I would have thought. I will tell you this in a non-braggadocious way... [Laughter] ... there has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. [Applause]
Today, again, the stock market has reached another record all-time high. [Applause] The unemployment rate nationwide is the lowest it's been in 17 years, and 13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state. And I hate to tell you, but Missouri happens to be one of them. [Applause]
We've created nearly two million jobs -- two million jobs. Think of that. We used to lose millions. Now, we've created two million jobs since I won the election, and I want to say, since you won the election. I didn't win the election. You won the election. [Applause]
And we will create countless more if we can sustain the 3 percent growth rate we have achieved for the past two quarters. But we're going to do much better than that. Remember I used to say we can hit 4 and we can hit 3, and they were all saying, forget it, forget it. It was 1.2. It was doing terribly. We were flat. We were even. In all fairness the stock market was going this way, and now we're hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time.
And the numbers going up are going to do much better than anybody anticipates. In fact, they're going to say that Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator -- the exact opposite. [Applause]
They're going to start saying Governor that he ought to be a little bit more optimistic because his predictions were low, can you believe it? You know, a year and a half ago they were saying, oh he can't do that. Now they're saying, hmm, that was quick.
But by the way the commerce department announced this morning that our GDP -- that's the big one -- in the third quarter grew even faster than they reported previously. They made a mistake. They were too low. They had it at 3 percent. By the way, 3 percent -- did you ever think you would hear that in less than a year? And now it comes in at 3.3 percent which is the largest increase in many years. [Applause]
And if we didn't have the hurricanes we would have been at 4 percent. The hurricanes were devastating. And I said they're worth a point. They said they were worth like .006, but I said they were worth a point. We would have been at 4 percent, maybe even over 4 percent, but we had hurricanes. We took care of them, in Texas, in Florida. They did a great, great job, amazing job, tremendous leadership, and we're very proud.
Puerto Rico has been a very tough situation because of the fact that it was in very, very bad shape before the storms ever hit. But they're doing well there, and it's healing, and it's getting better, and we're getting them power, and all of the things that they have to have.
But I want to tell you that a lot of brave people in every state. We have great, great people, and it's our number-one resource, believe me. Really great. [Applause]
But in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the Senate must pass those tax cuts. Bring Main Street roaring back, and that's what's going to happen. This is all done without the tax cuts. And I'm not sure that people even believe the tax cuts. I want to see what happens. And the big day will be either tomorrow or the next day. I would say do it now. We're ready. [Applause]
I said to the Republicans, and I want to tell you, these are good people. They really want to, and I know they get hit hard -- the Senators, the Congressmen, but they are all working hard. It's not so easy. It's complicated stuff. It's not so easy, but we had an incredible session yesterday.
And I think we're there. That's why I said, let's do -- can we do the vote today? What do I know? I'm a business guy? Can we do the vote now? Well they said, how about Friday? I said, I don't want to wait till Friday. [Laughter]
Right, Billy? I said, Billy, can we do the vote? Get me the vote. Well Billy has already passed it so. And then what happens if it passes it goes into this beautiful committee, this beautiful I call it a pot, and we mix it up, and we stir it up and bring all the best things out, and you're going to have something, I predict, that will be really, really special. So right now -- it really is. [Applause] It really is.
So right now, America's tax code is a total, dysfunctional mess. The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests, including myself -- in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me.
Believe -- This is not good for me. Me, it's not so -- I have some very wealthy friends. Not so happy with me, but that's OK. You know, I keep hearing Schumer: ""This is for the wealthy."""" Well
I have to explain why. Now, it is great for companies, because companies are going to bring back jobs, and we're lowering the rates very substantially. But right now, we're bringing the rates down from 35 percent, which is totally noncompetitive. The highest industrialized nation in the world by far, and we're bringing it all the way down to 20 percent. But that's good. [Applause]
That's good for everybody in the room, whether you have a company, or whether you want a job, because we're going to bring back jobs. And what we've had is a massive giveaway to foreign countries, which encouraged businesses to relocate offshores.
And you've seen what's happened before this. This is really -- most part, because as bad as our tax code is, we have Toyota. We have big car companies coming back in, building plants in Michigan, and other places. We have a lot of businesses coming back in, and they see what's happening. They see what's going on. That's why they're doing...
Our current code is a giant -- and really, it is. It's a self- inflicted economic wound. It's been that way for so many years, and nobody wanted to do anything about it.
But all that will change, and it will change immediately if Congress sends a tax cut and reform bill, the biggest tax cut in the history of our country -- bigger than Reagan. If they send it to my desk, I promise all of the people in this room, my friends, so many friends in this room. It's a great state. I promise you, I will sign it. [Applause]
I promise. I will not veto that bill. There will be no veto. Under the plan moving forward in the Senate, a typical family of four earning $75,000, as an example, will see their taxes go down by as much as $2,000. That's a lot. [Applause]
Now, we're doing that not just to help people; we're doing that because it helps our country. You're going to take that $2,000, and maybe you'll save some, and you're going to spend some. And we're going to make product back in our country again.
You know, it's going to be made here. It's going to be made elsewhere, but it's going to be made here. We're opening up plants, we're opening up factories, and we're going to be great to small business. Wait'll you see the final product. Wait'll you see what finally comes out in what I call the mixer.
The beating heart of our plan is a tax cut for working families. That's what it is. We're going to make sure... [Applause] ... that you keep more of your hard-earned money. We're going to make sure, also, that you have a job that you want. You're going to have choice.
You know, in education, we now have choice -- good word. Here, you're going to have a choice. You're not just going to have one job -- you're going to have a choice of many jobs. People are moving back into our country. Under our plan, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be totally income tax free -- zero. [Applause] And a married couple won't pay one dime of income tax on their first $24,000 of income -- zero. [Applause]
Our plan will significantly increase the child tax credit and make it available to more middle class families because the single most important investment our nation can make is in our children. Do we agree? Do you agree? You better agree. [Applause]
Families will also benefit from a new credit for other dependents like a child in college or an elderly loved one. We have our mothers, our fathers. You have your grandparents. You have people that are elderly that have done a fantastic job. They've grown old. You want to help them. Now we are going to help you help them. [Applause]
We're also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage by the wealthy. Who are they? I don't know. [Laughter] I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It's alright. Hey look, I'm president. I don't care. I don't care anymore. [Applause] Some of my wealthy friends care. Me, I don't care. This is a higher calling. Do we agree? [Applause] As Hillary said, ""What difference does it make?"""" [Laughter]""
It made a big difference. It made a big difference, made a big, big difference. We want a tax code that is simple and fair, and that's for all Americans. The plan that senators will be voting on this week, hopefully as soon as possible, closes the loopholes that corporations use to shift their profits to tax havens, and it eliminates dedications for CEO salaries over $1 million.
You see what some of these people are making? A little ridiculous. I'm driving up their stock. They're making a fortune, then they go to their board and they tell everybody what a great job they're doing, but what am I going to do? [Laughter] And many of them, honestly, I don't like. [Laughter] Some of these bankers, I don't like them, and they're making a fortune, and it's one of those things.
Steve knows a couple of them that I'm talking about, doesn't he? They say what a great job they do. Right now anybody could do their job because we're making it easy for them, because we're giving them a great and strong economy, and because we've cut regulations more than any president in the history of this country by far, and that's for full terms. That's not for ten months. [Applause]
And it allows builders to build, and it allows farmers to farm. You know what I've done for farmers? [Applause] Where if you had a little puddle in the middle of your field, you go to jail if you touch it, right? You know what I'm talking about. Not anymore. Not anymore. Not anymore. [Applause]
And it allows bankers to lend. It allows bankers to lend again. So many people came up to me and they said, we had a 20-year relationship with a bank. We never had a default. We never had a bad loan. Now they we go back to the bank and they say we can't do business with you anymore. Because they don't qualify. Even though they are better than the people that do qualify. It's incredible.
But we're back to the strong days of our banks and not the days of trouble pre that. We're back to the -- where bankers can make loans, and community bankers can make great loans to good people. You saw what happened recently where the certain agency or bureau that was causing so much trouble to lenders, where they could not lend. They just couldn't lend. It was devastating. They were going out of business.
Well, we're taking care of that. We've already taken care of a big part of it, and yesterday, you saw we won the lawsuit. So that's going to be taken care of automatically. [Applause] Got to get back to business.
Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America; the plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipefitters -- the people that like me best. [Laughter] Actually, the rich people actually don't like me, which is sort of interesting, and that's fine. I -- you know what? I like that trade.
But really, the people that like me best are those people, the workers. They're the people I understand the best. Those are the people I grew up with. Those are the people I worked on construction sites with. [Applause]
All of the people who give their best each and every day to take care of their family, and the country that they love. These are incredible people. They came out to vote for me. They came out to vote for us. People that worked hard -- two jobs, three jobs -- that hadn't voted in many years, because they'd never had anybody they wanted to vote for.
And they came out -- I'll never forget -- in Tennessee, a great Congressman told me they had early voting; said, ""I'll tell you what. We just went through four days of early voting."""" At that time
They haven't voted in years, and now they've got Trump shirts, and they've got Trump hats, and they've got Trump-Pence, and they've got everything Trump, and Trump-Pence."" And he said
Because we had a big one here. And I promised Josh that when he gets it going -- and he has got it in very good shape, from what I hear. He's a popular -- everybody said, ""Josh. It's got to be Josh."""" Everyone's telling me. I said
It's not enough for the middle class to keep getting by. We want them to start getting way ahead. We're going to have them start getting way ahead. Under our plan, middle-class families will not only see their tax bill go down; they will see their incomes go up by an average of around $4,000. [Applause]
And that's because we're going to cut taxes on American businesses, so they will compete for workers. They'll raise salaries. The business is going to be happy, and the workers are going to be happy, and the country is going to be a happy place. Although, we're going to have very strong borders. Please remember that, OK? Please remember. [Applause]
We're going to have the wall. Don't worry about it. We're going to have the wall. We don't forget that wall. A lot of people say, ""Now that he got elected
They don't want to take care of your military. And all their good at, frankly, this is obstructing. They want to obstruct. But you know what? They may obstruct, but we have gotten through all of the obstruction so far. We will keep it going, believe me.
Today, America has one of the least competitive tax rates on planet Earth, 60 percent, think of that, 60 percent higher than the average in the developed world. So our taxes are 60 percent higher. On my recent trip to Asia, every single one of the countries I visited, even those with communist governments, have slashed its corporate tax rates and slashed them dramatically.
And it's very tough competition anyway. But when their taxes are a lot lower, it really makes it very tough. And that trip was a tremendous success. You know, we brought back $250 billion in contracts, that's going to be over $1 trillion very soon, that's a good -- that's a good week and a half's work.
Boeing came back with contracts, so many of our companies can back and I'm very proud of them and we're doing great. But at the same time, we're going to fix trade because trade's unfair. We're getting killed on trade.
So we're going to fix our trade, unless anybody would like to continue with this horrible situation that we have. Our plan gets America from the back of the pack and it will bring us right to number one where we were for years, but where we haven't been for decades. We're going to be right back at number one. [Applause]
And we're going to work on trade, but we're also to work on military. When we defend nations that are very wealthy and we do it for almost nothing. I say, why are we defending them, we love them, I won't mention names. But there are a lot of them. We love them, they're wealthy. One of them has a cash flow that they say is unsustainable it's so large.
Think of that. How would you like to have an unsustainable cash flow? They don't know what to do with their money and we defend them. It's going to change folks, we're going to defend them, but they're going to treat us fairly. And they're going to pay for their defense, does that make sense? [Applause]
And a lot of this was from many, many years ago when we defended a defeated country, and then they became strong and they became rich and we just kept the same defense. What happened, why didn't anybody go in and negotiate?
And when I was in Asia, I spoke to a couple of the countries about it. And they looked like this, you know what this is? That means they know they're getting away with murder and they got to start helping us out, OK?
So if you don't mind, I'll start bringing that up with some of our good friends. We're going to cut our tax rate to the very competitive number of 20 percent, as I said, and we're going to create jobs and factories will be pouring into this country.
They already are starting. A lot of people think it's going to happen. I don't want to say anything, I'm not going to talk about it. I thought we had healthcare and we will have healthcare, it's going to happen. Soon as we get the taxes, we work on the healthcare, we're going to happen because we thought we had that votes and then we -- something happened, a little strange. That's OK.
When you lose by one vote, then it's called, you go back. You know, some people said, ""Oh
And by the way, what happened, what happened, is Obama took a long time, years to get Obamacare, right? Again, 10 months. We've had two runs at it. We're coming closer, closer. I think now we have a plan that's going to be great. But we're not talking about it until after taxes, and then we take care of health care.
Then we will have done tax cuts, the biggest in history, health care, phenomenal health care. I know you don't want this -- welfare reform. Does anyone want welfare reform? [Applause]
And infrastructure. But welfare reform, I see it, and I've talked to people. I know people that work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all. And the person who is not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her ass off. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. [Applause]
So we're going to go into welfare reform, unless Billy doesn't want it. Billy, am I okay in saying that I speak for you. He said yes. You got a lot of friends out there, Bill. Well, we're also cut taxes for the millions for small businesses that file as individuals, and that's going to come out of the hopper. It's getting there and it's going to be better and better. We're reducing the tax burden on businesses of all sizes and of every single kind.
As a candidate, I pledged to fight for American jobs. It think it's possibly the number one reason I got elected, and I think we've done a lot better at this point than anybody ever even thought possible.
Think of that, two million jobs since the election, two million more jobs in this country since the election. Nobody expected that. Excuse me, I didn't even expect that.
But, you know, you cut those regulations and you give people spirit and incentive, and when you have the highest ratings in terms of confidence that the country has had in many, many years, maybe ever, things happen. The tax cut will mean more companies moving to America, staying in America and hiring American workers right here. So that's so important, right? [Applause]
Small business groups across our nation -- retailers, restaurants, manufactures, grocers, contractors -- support this plan. We have tremendous support for this plan, tremendous. Because these massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel... [Laughter] ... little rocket man, rocket fuel for the American economy. [Applause] He is a sick puppy.
Cassandra Poirier, where is she? Where is Cassandra. Is she around here? Hello, Cassandra. I met you back there. She and her mother, Terri. Hi, Terri. They own a jewelry store on Main Street right here in St. Charles. They make really beautiful handmade jewelry. I got to see some of it. I would have taken it in my previous life, but now if I do they don't like that. You're not -- we're not allowed to take jewelry, right?
But they make it right here in the heartland. It's beautiful. Our tax plan will insure that Cassandra can keep growing her business, keep creating jobs, keep giving back to the community that she loves, and just make her more and more successful. I assume you like that, right? Good.
Randy Schilling is also here. Where is Randy? Randy? Hello, Randy. He's the founder of OPO. That's an interesting name. It's called OPO Startups, and a member to dozens of small businesses in the St. Charles area. He's a mentor. He really mentors a lot of the businesses, and he's respected. He also did a terrific job renovating the old post office on Main Street, something I know something about -- old post offices. Did he do a good job, by the way? I hear. [Applause]
They said yes, Randy. If he did a bad job, I'm going to stop right now and just say, ""Good luck
Randy knows firsthand how the high tax burden is holding America's small businesses back, and our tax-cut plan will unleash them to thrive like never before. He understands our plan, which will provide relief from the horrible, crushing, unfair estate tax, also known to many as the death tax. [Applause]
We want to make it easier for loving families to pass on their life's work to their children. Be nice. Be very nice, right? [Applause]
That's a tough one. The Democrats, the Democrats fight that one, I think, harder than any other thing that we're doing. They fight the death tax. They don't want it. They don't like it. They don't want it. It's one of those things, but that is one of the hardest things. I have to be -- I see people right here. They're obviously very rich, and they love their children, right? In this group?
They love their children. They're very rich. They want to pass on what they have without having to have the kids sell the property, mortgage up half of it. And -- but the biggest problem we have on that one: These Democrats are being brutal. And you know, I call them obstructionists. But they want to stop the estate tax. They want to stop the death tax from, you know, being rescinded. But we're going to try our best on that one.
Our economy will receive another enormous boost as trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas will be able to come back to our country. Now, this is one that's interesting, because for years, Republicans and Democrats agreed. You have Apple, and you have these great companies having billions and billions of dollars overseas. Now, who doesn't want the money to come back?
But to show you the lack of leadership that this country had in the past, the Republicans want it, and the Democrats want it, and nothing ever happened. You could have passed that one, easy. In fact, we're just throwing it into this bill. I could have had a separate bill on that one, I think. Don't you agree, fellas? I could have had a separate bill on that one, and gotten it passed in record time. But I figured I'd put it here, because it is actually popular.
But it used to be $2.5 trillion. You know what that is? Trillion -- money you can't bring back in. It's too -- it's prohibitive, both in complexity, and in the amount of tax you have to pay. So nobody brings back in. $2.5 trillion.
But $2.5 trillion, I've been saying for six years. I think now it's $4 to $5 trillion. All that money is coming back into the United States, and it's going to be invested in our country, instead of sitting and helping others. We want our own help. [Applause] That's sort of an easy one.
Last year, American multinational companies left more than 70 percent of their foreign profits overseas because the current tax system penalizes them for bringing that money back home. They actually get penalized.
Our plan switches to a territorial tax system that encourages companies to return their profits to America -- right here to the United States, where that money belongs, going back to work for you -- territorial. [Applause]
If we want America to thrive in the 21st century, then we must stop running from the competition and instead we must start totally winning, and winning, and winning, again. Remember what I used to say?
We're going to win so much, we're going to win that the people of Missouri are going to go to your governor and they're going to say, governor, please go see the president. We can't stand winning so much. Remember I used to say that, right? I used to say it and that's what's happening. That's what's happening. [Applause]
And then the governor's going to come to that beautiful, historic Oval Office, he's going to say to me, Mr. President, the people of Missouri cannot stand all this winning. They don't want to win so much.
They love the old way where they had lousy job numbers, lousy economic numbers, lousy -- they loved it. Please, Mr. President, please not -- and I'll say Governor, I don't care what they say in Missouri, we're going to keep winning, and winning, and winning, and winning and we're -- remember? That's right. [Applause]
I used to say that, I had fun with that. But we are winning, we're winning again. We're winning a lot bigger than anyone ever thought possible for such a short period of time. For too long, our tax code has incentivized companies to leave our country in search of lower tax rates. It happens, many, many companies, they're going to Ireland, they're going all over.
They're going all over Asia, but they're stopping because they now want to take advantage of what is happening and what we're about to pass, hopefully. My administration rejects the off-shoring model. In other words, let's build a factory in the other country, isn't that wonderful?
That really helps us a lot. Fire everybody and let's build the product, and let's send it in without tax back into the United States. That model doesn't work for me. It never worked and it shouldn't have worked for any of our other past presidents, believe me. [Applause]
Our new model is the American model. Call it the Trump model, where we build it here. As much as possible, we build in here. Simply put, our tax plan is anti off-shoring and 100 percent worker, 100 percent pro-America. [Applause]
Under the American model, we're reducing burdens on our business as long as they do business in our country. OK? They do business here. Now, we love Mexico, it's a wonderful place. But I don't like when our car companies move to Mexico, fire everybody, build the same car in Mexico, send it through our borders with no taxes, no nothing, and we buy the car, same price, we buy the car.
In the meantime, what do we get out of it, we get no tax and we get unemployment all over. That's stopping. So now, the plants are starting to move back. And now there's a price to pay when they do that little number on us. [Applause] That's how we all succeed and we grow together as one team, one people, as one American family. [Applause]
This week's vote can be the beginning of the next great chapter for the American worker. To summarize, our plan cuts taxes for the working and middle-income families. It nearly doubles the amount of income taxed at the rate of zero. It lowers tax rate. It expands the child tax credit. It provides relief from the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
It cuts small business taxes. It reduces the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way down to 20 percent, and it provides a one-time low tax rate to return corporate money parked overseas -- trillions and trillions of dollars.
This is the right plan. This is the right time. We have a moment in time. The Republicans have the Senate. The Republicans have the House. The Republicans have the White House. It's very unusual, very unusual. [Applause]
This is our chance to free our economy from our workers, from the terrible tax burdens. We have workers that are so burdened with taxes. We're freeing our workers from those terrible burdens. Republicans in Congress campaigned on cutting taxes. We also campaigned on repeal and replace -- it's going to happen. It's going to happen. Take your time. It's going to happen. Going to happen.
Many Democrats have promised tax cuts that don't mean anything because they really want major tax increases. Senator Claire McCaskill -- have you ever heard of her? [Booing]
Is doing you a tremendous disservice. She wants your taxes to go up. She's weak on crime. She's weak on borders. She's weak on illegal immigration. And she's weak on the military. Other than that, I think she's doing a fantastic job. [Laughter]
But now comes the moment of truth. In the coming days, the American people will learn which politicians are part of the swamp and which politicians want to drain the swamp. [Applause]
If you make your voices heard and call up your congressmen -- and they've been terrific. And call up your Senators, and they have been totally terrific. Most of them have been incredible. They really are. They're really friends of mine. They've been incredible. But it doesn't take much. That's why we need more. We need to have a larger number.
Most of them have been incredible, but call your Senators. Call your Congressmen because we have no choice. We have to act. We have to act as a country. This isn't good for the Republican Party. This is good for the country. And that's, ultimately, what it's all about. [Applause]
So this week, hopefully, the Senate can join the House and take that strong stand for middle-class families and for business and for jobs and for competition and for bringing money back. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present. [Applause]
And remember, I was the one when I was here the last time, I said, we're going to have Christmas again; I was the one that said you go to the department stores and you see Happy New Year and you see red and you see snow and you see all these things. You don't see Merry Christmas anymore.
With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big beautiful tax cut. Thank you everybody. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much."
2017-11-10,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses APEC CEO Summit,Vietnam,"[108.277199, 14.058324]",donald-trump-speech-apec-ceo-summit-november-10-2017,"What an honor it is to be here in Vietnam -- in the very heart of the Indo-Pacific -- to address the people and business leaders of this region.
This has already been a remarkable week for the United States in this wonderful part of the world. Starting from Hawaii, Melania and I traveled to Japan, South Korea, and China, and now to Vietnam, to be here with all of you today.
Before we begin, I want to address all those affected by Typhoon Damrey. Americans are praying for you and for your recovery in the months ahead. Our hearts are united with the Vietnamese people suffering in the aftermath of this terrible storm.
This trip comes at an exciting time for America. A new optimism has swept all across our country. Economic growth has reached 3.2 percent, and going higher. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. The stock market is at an all-time high. And the whole world is lifted by America's renewal.
Everywhere I've traveled on this journey, I've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from America. But even more, I've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific -- a place where sovereign and independent nations, with diverse cultures and many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side, and thrive in freedom and in peace.
I am so thrilled to be here today at APEC, because this organization was founded to help achieve that very purpose. America stands as a proud member of the community of nations who make a home on the Pacific. We have been an active partner in this region since we first won independence ourselves.
In 1784, the first American ship sailed to China from the newly independent United States. It went loaded with goods to sell in Asia, and it came back full of porcelain and tea. Our first president, George Washington himself, owned a set of tableware from that ship.
In 1804, Thomas Jefferson sent the explorers, Lewis and Clark, on an expedition to our Pacific Coast. They were the first of the millions of Americans who ventured west to live out America's manifest destiny across our vast continent.
In 1817, our Congress approved the first full-time Pacific development [deployment] of an American warship. That initial naval presence soon grew into a squadron, and then a fleet, to guarantee freedom of navigation for the growing number of ships, braving the high seas to reach markets in the Philippines, Singapore, and in India.
In 1818, we began our relationship with the Kingdom of Thailand, and 15 years later our two countries signed a treaty of friendship and commerce -- our first with an Asian nation.
In the next century, when imperialist powers threatened this region, the United States pushed back at great cost to ourselves. We understood that security and prosperity depended on it.
We have been friends, partners, and allies in the Indo-Pacific for a long, long time, and we will be friends, partners, and allies for a long time to come.
As old friends in the region, no one has been more delighted than America to witness, to help, and to share in the extraordinary progress you have made over the last half-century.
What the countries and economies represented here today have built in this part of the world is nothing short of miraculous. The story of this region in recent decades is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
Few would have imagined just a generation ago that leaders of these nations would come together here in Da Nang to deepen our friendships, expand our partnerships, and celebrate the amazing achievements of our people.
This city was once home to an American military base, in a country where many Americans and Vietnamese lost their lives in a very bloody war.
Today, we are no longer enemies; we are friends. And this port city is bustling with ships from around the world. Engineering marvels, like the Dragon Bridge, welcome the millions who come to visit Da Nang's stunning beaches, shining lights, and ancient charms.
In the early 1990s, nearly half of Vietnam survived on just a few dollars a day, and one in four did not have any electricity. Today, an opening Vietnamese economy is one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth. It has already increased more than 30 times over, and the Vietnamese students rank among the best students in the world. [Applause] And that is very impressive.
This is the same story of incredible transformation that we have seen across the region. Indonesians for decades have been building domestic and democratic institutions to govern their vast chain of more than 13,000 islands. Since the 1990s, Indonesia's people have lifted themselves from poverty to become one of the fastest-growing nations of the G20. Today, it is the third-largest democracy on Earth.
The Philippines has emerged as a proud nation of strong and devout families. For 11 consecutive years, the World Economic Forum has ranked the Philippines first among Asian countries in closing the gender gap and embracing women leaders in business and in politics. [Applause]
The Kingdom of Thailand has become an upper middle-income country in less than a generation. Its majestic capital of Bangkok is now the most visited city on Earth. And that is very impressive. Not too many people here are from Thailand. [Applause]
Malaysia has rapidly developed through recent decades, and it is now ranked as one of the best places in the world to do business.
In Singapore, citizens born to parents who survived on $500 dollars a day [year] are now among the highest earners in the world -- a transformation made possible by the vision of Lee Kwan Yew's vision of honest governance and the rule of law. [Applause] And his great son is now doing an amazing job.
As I recently observed in South Korea, the people of that Republic took a poor country ravaged by war, and in just a few decades turned it into one of the wealthiest democracies on Earth. Today, South Koreans enjoy higher incomes than the citizens of many European Union countries. It was great spending time with President Moon.
Everyone knows of China's impressive achievements over the past several decades. During this period -- and it was a period of great market reforms -- large parts of China experienced rapid economic growth, jobs boomed, and more than 800 million citizens rose out of poverty. I just left China this morning and had a really productive meeting and a wonderful time with our gracious host, President Xi.
And, as I saw on my first stop of this trip, in Japan we see a dynamic democracy in a land of industrial, technological, and cultural wonders. In fewer than 60 years, that island nation has produced 24 Nobel Prize winners for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and the promotion of peace. [Applause] President Abe and I agree on so much.
In the broader region, countries outside of APEC are also making great strides in this new chapter for the Indo-Pacific.
India is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its independence. It is a sovereign democracy, as well as -- think of this -- over 1 billion people. It's the largest democracy in the world. [Applause]
Since India opened its economy, it has achieved astounding growth and a new world of opportunity for its expanding middle class. And Prime Minister Modi has been working to bring that vast country, and all of its people, together as one. And he is working at it very, very successfully, indeed.
As we can see, in more and more places throughout this region, citizens of sovereign and independent nations have taken greater control of their destinies and unlocked the potential of their people.
They've pursued visions of justice and accountability, promoted private property and the rule of law, and embraced systems that value hard work and individual enterprise.
They built businesses, they built cities, they built entire countries from the ground up. Many of you in this room have taken part in these great, uplifting national projects of building. They have been your projects from inception to completion, from dreams to reality.
With your help, this entire region has emerged -- and it is still emerging -- as a beautiful constellation of nations, each its own bright star, satellites to none -- and each one, a people, a culture, a way of life, and a home.
Those of you who have lived through these transformations understand better than anyone the value of what you have achieved. You also understand that your home is your legacy, and you must always protect it.
In the process of your economic development, you've sought commerce and trade with other nations, and forged partnerships based on mutual respect and directed toward mutual gain.
Today, I am here to offer a renewed partnership with America to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the Indo-Pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security.
At the core of this partnership, we seek robust trade relationships rooted in the principles of fairness and reciprocity. When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will, from now on, expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do. We expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides, and that private industry, not government planners, will direct investment.
Unfortunately, for too long and in too many places, the opposite has happened. For many years, the United States systematically opened our economy with few conditions. We lowered or ended tariffs, reduced trade barriers, and allowed foreign goods to flow freely into our country.
But while we lowered market barriers, other countries didn't open their markets to us.
[Audience member calls out] Funny. They must have been one of the beneficiaries. [Applause] What country do you come from, sir?
Countries were embraced by the World Trade Organization, even if they did not abide by its stated principles. Simply put, we have not been treated fairly by the World Trade Organization. Organizations like the WTO can only function properly when all members follow the rules and respect the sovereign rights of every member. We cannot achieve open markets if we do not ensure fair market access. In the end, unfair trade undermines us all.
The United States promoted private enterprise, innovation, and industry. Other countries used government-run industrial planning and state-owned enterprises.
We adhered to WTO principles on protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair and equal market access. They engaged in product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial policies.
They ignored the rules to gain advantage over those who followed the rules, causing enormous distortions in commerce and threatening the foundations of international trade itself.
Such practices, along with our collective failure to respond to them, hurt many people in our country and also in other countries. Jobs, factories, and industries were stripped out of the United States and out of many countries in addition. And many opportunities for mutually beneficial investments were lost because people could not trust the system.
We can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them. Despite years of broken promises, we were told that someday soon everyone would behave fairly and responsibly. People in America and throughout the Indo-Pacific region have waited for that day to come. But it never has, and that is why I am here today -- to speak frankly about our challenges and work toward a brighter future for all of us.
I recently had an excellent trip to China, where I spoke openly and directly with President Xi about China's unfair trade practices and the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States. I expressed our strong desire to work with China to achieve a trading relationship that is conducted on a truly fair and equal basis.
The current trade imbalance is not acceptable. I do not blame China or any other country, of which there are many, for taking advantage of the United States on trade. If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs. I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.
From this day forward, we will compete on a fair and equal basis. We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore. I am always going to put America first the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first. [Applause]
The United States is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interest of both your countries and mine. That is the message I am here to deliver.
I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade. What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.
Instead, we will deal on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will respect your independence and your sovereignty. We want you to be strong, prosperous, and self-reliant, rooted in your history, and branching out toward the future. That is how we will thrive and grow together, in partnerships of real and lasting value.
But for this -- and I call it the Indo-Pacific dream -- if it's going to be realized, we must ensure that all play by the rules, which they do not right now. Those who do will be our closest economic partners. Those who do not can be certain that the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.
We will no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property. We will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technology to the state, and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access.
We will address the massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state-owned enterprises that put private competitors out of business -- happening all the time.
We will not remain silent as American companies are targeted by state-affiliated actors for economic gain, whether through cyberattacks, corporate espionage, or other anti-competitive practices. We will encourage all nations to speak out loudly when the principles of fairness and reciprocity are violated.
We know it is in America's interests to have partners throughout this region that are thriving, prosperous, and dependent on no one. We will not make decisions for the purpose of power or patronage. We will never ask our partners to surrender their sovereignty, privacy, and intellectual property, or to limit contracts to state-owned suppliers.
We will find opportunities for our private sector to work with yours and to create jobs and wealth for us all. We seek strong partners, not weak partners. We seek strong neighbors, not weak neighbors. Above all, we seek friendship, and we don't dream of domination.
For this reason, we are also refocusing our existing development efforts. We are calling on the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to direct their efforts toward high-quality infrastructure investment that promotes economic growth.
The United States will also do its part. We are also committed to reforming our development finance institutions so that they better incentivize private sector investment in your economies, and provide strong alternatives to state-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.
The United States has been reminded time and time again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security. Economic security is national security. It is vital -- (applause) -- to our national strength.
We also know that we will not have lasting prosperity if we do not confront grave threats to security, sovereignty, and stability facing our world today.
Earlier this week, I addressed the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea and urged every responsible nation to stand united in declaring that every single step the North Korean regime takes toward more weapons is a step it takes into greater and greater danger. The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail.
In addition, we must uphold principles that have benefitted all of us, like respect for the rule of law -- (applause) -- individual rights, and freedom of navigation and overflight, including open shipping lanes. Three principles and these principles -- (applause) -- create stability and build trust, security, and prosperity among like-minded nations.
We must also deal decisively with other threats to our security and the future of our children, such as criminal cartels, human smuggling, drugs, corruption, cybercrime, and territorial expansion. As I have said many times before: All civilized people must come together to drive out terrorists and extremists from our societies, stripping them of funding, territory, and ideological support. We must stop radical Islamic terrorism.
So let us work together for a peaceful, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific. I am confident that, together, every problem we have spoken about today can be solved and every challenge we face can be overcome.
If we succeed in this effort, if we seize the opportunities before us and ground our partnerships firmly in the interests of our own people, then together we will achieve everything we dream for our nations and for our children.
We will be blessed with a world of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, thriving in peace and commerce with others. They will be places where we can build our homes and where families, businesses, and people can flourish and grow.
If we do this, will we look at the globe half a century from now, and we will marvel at the beautiful constellation of nations -- each different, each unique, and each shining brightly and proudly throughout this region of the world. And just as when we look at the stars in the night sky, the distance of time will make most of the challenges we have and that we spoke of today seem very, very small.
What will not seem small -- what is not small -- will be the big choices that all of our nations will have to make to keep their stars glowing very, very brightly.
In America, like every nation that has won and defended its sovereignty, we understand that we have nothing so precious as our birthright, our treasured independence, and our freedom.
That knowledge has guided us throughout American history. It has inspired us to sacrifice and innovate. And it is why today, hundreds of years after our victory in the American Revolution, we still remember the words of an American founder and our second President of the United States, John Adams.
As an old man, just before his death, this great patriot was asked to offer his thoughts on the 50th anniversary of glorious American freedom. He replied with the words: independence forever.
It's a sentiment that burns in the heart of every patriot and every nation. Our hosts here in Vietnam have known this sentiment not just for 200 years, but for nearly 2,000 years. [Applause] It was around 40 AD when two Vietnamese sisters, the Trung Sisters, first awakened the spirit of the people of this land. It was then that, for the first time, the people of Vietnam stood for your independence and your pride.
Today, the patriots and heroes -- (applause) -- of our histories hold the answers to the great questions of our future and our time. They remind us of who we are and what we are called to do.
Together, we have it in our power to lift our people and our world to new heights -- heights that have never been attained,
So let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose wealth and freedom over poverty and servitude. Let us choose a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Finally, let us never forget the world has many places -- (applause) -- many dreams, and many roads. But in all of the world, there is no place like home.
And so, for family, for country, for freedom, for history, and for the glory of God, protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time. [Applause]
Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless the Pacific region. And God Bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-10-26,Speech: Donald Trump on Combatting Drug and Opioid Demand,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-drug-opioid-abuse-october-26-2017,"Thank you, Melania, for your moving words and for your devotion -- it's a very deep devotion, I can tell you that -- to our nation and its children.
Thank you also to members of Congress, my Cabinet, governors, members of Congress, state, local leaders, first responders, and healthcare professionals gathered here today. We have some truly incredible people in this room -- that I can tell you.
Most importantly, we acknowledge the families present who have lost a cherished loved one. As you all know from personal experience, families, communities, and citizens across our country are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in American history and even, if you really think about it, world history. This is all throughout the world. The fact is this is a worldwide problem.
This crisis of drug use, addiction, and overdose deaths in many years, it's just been so long in the making. Addressing it will require all of our effort and it will require us to confront the crisis in all of its very real complexity.
Last year, we lost at least 64,000 Americans to overdoses. Thatâs 175 lost American lives per day. Thatâs seven lost lives per hour in our country. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States by far.
More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined. Think of it -- motor vehicle crashes, gun homicides, more people by far from drug overdoses.
These overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction to prescription painkillers, heroin, and other opioids. Last year, almost 1 million Americans used heroin, and more than 11 million abused prescription opioids.
The United States is by far the largest consumer of these drugs, using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world. Opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999 and now account for the majority of fatal drug overdoses. Who would have thought?
No part of our society -- not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural -- has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that's taken place with opioids.
In West Virginia -- a truly great state, great people -- there is a hospital nursery where one in every five babies spends its first days in agony. Because these precious babies were exposed to opioids or other drugs in the womb, they endure nausea, pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, and trouble eating, just the same as adults undergoing detox.
Some of these children will likely lose one or both of their parents to drug addiction and overdose. They will join the growing ranks of Americaâs opioid orphans. Such beautiful, beautiful babies.
Beyond the shocking death toll, the terrible measure of the opioid crisis includes the families ripped apart and, for many communities, a generation of lost potential and opportunity.
This epidemic is a national health emergency, unlike many of us we've seen and what we've seen in our lifetimes. Nobody has seen anything like what's going on now.
As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue. It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. Never been this way. We can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic. We can do it. [Applause] We can do it.
That is why, effective today, my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law, and why I am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis. This marks a critical step in confronting the extraordinary challenge that we face.
As part of this emergency response, we will announce a new policy to overcome a restrictive 1970s-era rule that prevents states from providing care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds for those suffering from drug addiction. [Applause]
A number of states have reached out to us asking for relief, and you should expect to see approvals that will unlock treatment for people in need. And those approvals will come very, very fast. Not like in the past -- very, very quickly.
Ending the epidemic will require mobilization of government, local communities, and private organizations. It will require the resolve of our entire country.
The scale of this crisis of addiction is why, soon after coming into office, I convened a presidential commission, headed by Governor Chris Christie, that has consulted with experts across America to listen, to learn, and report back on potential solutions.
We await the final report, which will come in next week. And I know some of the report has already been seen, because I want to see it as quickly as possible. And some of the things that they are recommending are common sense, but very, very important. And they're going to have a tremendous impact, believe me -- tremendous impact.
Today, I will detail many of these aggressive steps with my administration, which we've already taken. After we review and evaluate the commissionâs findings, I will quickly move to implement approximate and appropriate recommendations.
But I want the American people to know: The federal government is aggressively fighting the opioid epidemic on all fronts. We're working with doctors and medical professionals to implement best practices for safe opioid prescribing, and we will do something very, very special. We are requiring federally employed prescribers to receive, finally, special training.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a prescription awareness campaign to put faces on the danger of opioid abuse.
I want to acknowledge CVS Caremark for announcing last month that it will limit certain first-time opioid prescriptions to seven-day supplies, among other important reforms. And I encourage other companies to do their part to help to stop this epidemic. [Applause]
The FDA is now requiring drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids to provide more training to prescribers and to help prevent abuse and addiction, and has requested that one especially high-risk opioid be withdrawn from the market immediately. We are requiring that a specific opioid, which is truly evil, be taken off the market immediately. [Applause]
The U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Homeland Security are strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China and 50 times stronger than heroin.
And in two weeks, I will be in China with President Xi, and I will mention this as a top priority. [Applause] And he will do something about it.
I am also pleased to report that for the first time, the Department of Justice has indicated [indicted] major Chinese drug traffickers for distributing -- and they have really put very, very strong clamps on them. They've indicted them, the drug traffickers, for distributing fentanyl in the United States. So, Jeff, thank you very much. Good job. [Applause]
And they've been indicted and we're not going to forget about them, believe me. They are doing tremendous harm to our country. The Justice Department is aggressively and, really, valiantly pursuing those who illegally prescribe and traffic in opioids, both in our communities and on the Internet.
And I will be looking at the potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad actors. What they have and what they're doing to our people is unheard of. We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that are hurting our people. And that will start taking place pretty soon. [Applause]
We're also supporting first responders' and medical professionalsâ access to the tools they need to prevent deaths through life-saving overdose medications.
At my direction, the National Institute of Health, headed up by Francis Collins, has taken the first steps of an ambitious public-private partnership with pharmaceutical companies to develop non-addictive painkillers and new treatments for addiction and overdose. So important. [Applause]
I will be pushing the concept of non-addictive painkillers very, very hard. We have to come up with that solution. We give away billions and billions of dollars a year, and we're going to be spending lots of money on coming up with a non-addictive solution.
We will be asking Dr. Collins and the NIH for substantial resources in the fight against drug addiction. One of the things our administration will be doing is a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place because they will see the devastation and the ruination it causes to people and people's lives.
Watch what happens, if we do our jobs, how the number of drug users and the addicted will start to tumble downward over a period of years. It will be a beautiful thing to see.
I learned, myself -- I had a brother, Fred -- great guy, best-looking guy, best personality -- much better than mine. [Laughter] But he had a problem. He had a problem with alcohol, and he would tell me, ""Donât drink. Don't drink.""""""
He was substantially older, and I listened to him and I respected, but he would constantly tell me, don't drink. He'd also add, don't smoke. But he would say it over and over and over again.
And to this day, I've never had a drink. And I have no longing for it. I have no interest in it. To this day, I've never had a cigarette. Don't worry, those are only two of my good things. I don't want to tell you about the bad things. [Laughter] There's plenty of bad things too.
But he really helped me. I had somebody that guided me, and he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol -- believe me, very, very tough, tough life. He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through. But I learned because of Fred. I learned.
And that's what I think is so important. This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs -- just not to take them. When I see friends of mine that are having difficulty with not having that drink at dinner, where it's literally almost impossible for them to stop, I say to myself, I can't even understand it -- why would that be difficult? But we understand why it is difficult.
The fact is, if we can teach young people -- and people, generally -- not to start, it's really, really easy not to take them. And I think that's going to end up being our most important thing. Really tough, really big, really great advertising, so we get to people before they start, so they don't have to go through the problems of what people are going through. [Applause] Thank you.
We are already distributing nearly $1 billion in grants for addiction prevention and treatment, and over $50 million dollars to support law enforcement programs that assist those facing prison and facing addiction.
We have also launched an $81 million partnership to research better pain management techniques for our incredible veterans. And soon -- [Applause] -- and, by the way, Secretary Shulkin is here.
You have done an incredible job for our veterans in a very short period of time. [Applause] And soon, HHS will launch a taskforce to develop and update best practices for pain management across the federal government.
I am urging all Americans to help fight this opioid epidemic and the broader issue of drug addiction by participating in the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day this Saturday. When you can safely turn in these dangerous and horrible drugs for disposal, that will be a wonderful, wonderful period of time for you.
All of these actions are important parts of my administrationâs larger effort to confront the drug addiction crisis in America and confront it head on, straight on -- strong. We're going to do it. We're going to do it.
For too long, we have allowed drugs to ravage American homes, cities, and towns. We owe it to our children and our country to do everything in our power to address this national shame and this human tragedy.
We must stop the flow of all types of illegal drugs into our communities. [Applause] For too long, dangerous criminal cartels have been allowed to infiltrate and spread throughout our nation. An astonishing 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from south of the border, where we will be building a wall which will greatly help in this problem. [Applause]
It will have a great impact. My administration is dedicated to enforcing our immigration laws, defending our maritime security, and securing our borders.
We also have to work with other countries to stop these drugs where they originate. We have no choice. We have to work with others, we have to get together, because they have similar problems to what we have.
Some countries have bigger problems than we have. Whether that country is China, whether it's a country in Latin America, it makes no difference. We're going to be working with all of them. Weâre taking the fight directly to the criminals in places that they're producing this poison.
Here in America, we are once again enforcing the law; breaking up gangs and distribution networks; and arresting criminals who peddle dangerous drugs to our youth.
In addition, we understand the need to confront reality, right smack in the face, that millions of our fellow citizens are already addicted. That's the reality. We want them to get the help they need. We have no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering so they can recover and rebuild their lives with their families.
We're committed to pursuing innovative approaches that have been proven to work, like drug courts. Our efforts will be based on sound metrics, and guided by evidence and guided by results. This includes making addiction treatment available to those in prison and to help them eventually reenter society as productive and law-abiding citizens.
Finally, we must adopt the most common-sense solution of all: to prevent our citizens from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place. [Applause]
We must and are focusing so much of our effort on drug demand reduction. We must confront the culture of drug abuse head-on to reduce demand for dangerous narcotics. Every person who buys illicit drugs here in America should know that they are risking their futures, their families, and even their lives.
And every American should know that if they purchase illegal drugs, they are helping to finance some of the most violent, cruel, and ruthless organizations anywhere in the world. Illegal drug use is not a victimless crime. There is nothing admirable, positive, or socially desirable about it. There is nothing desirable about drugs. They're bad.
We want the next generation of young Americans to know the blessings of a drug-free life. In this enormous struggle against drug addiction, an opioid epidemic -- it really is that; it is an epidemic -- our greatest hope is the same as it has always been.
Through every trial America has encountered throughout our history, the spirit of our people and the strength of our character, we win. Each of us has a responsibility to this effort. We have a total responsibility to ourselves, to our family, to our country, including those who are struggling with this addiction.
Each of us is responsible to look out for our loved ones, our communities, our children, our neighbors, and our own health. Almost every American has witnessed the horrors of addiction. Whether itâs through their own struggle or through the struggle of a friend, a coworker, a neighbor or, frankly, a family member, our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths, will get worse before it gets better.
But get better it will. It will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society, but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency.
We are inspired by the stories of everyday heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair through leadership and through love.
Fire Chief Dan Goonan, of New Hampshire -- great state -- runs a program, Safe Station, which allows drug-dependent residents to seek help at fire stations at any time. Jesse and Cyndi Swafford of Dayton, Ohio have provided a loving, stable home to children affected by the opioid crisis.
I am calling on every American to join the ranks of guardian angels like Chief Goonan and the Swaffords, who help lift up the people of our great nation.
Together, we will care for our citizens, our children, and our orphans and our -- and you know what I'm going to say -- our foster youth. So many. So many. But we're going to lift them up, and we're going to take care of them. We will work to strengthen vulnerable families and communities, and we will help to build and grow a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society.
Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need.
Working together, we will defeat this opioid epidemic. It will be defeated. We will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse. And, yes, we will overcome addiction in America. We are going to overcome addiction in America.
We have fought and won many battles and many wars before, and we will win again. Thank you. God bless you. And God Bless America. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you. Here we go. This is very important: ""Combatting the National Drug Demand and Opioid Crisis."""" Right? So important. We will win"

Every Fourth of July, we celebrate the day America declared its independence. But this month, let us also remember the day our country won its independence. Next Thursday, October 19, marks the 236th anniversary of the day that George Washington's Continental Army defeated the British at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.
When our young American flag waved that day over the British surrender, it marked more than a victory of American arms. It represented the emergence of Stars and Stripes as a beacon of freedom around the world.
On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress resolved that our flag shall consist of 13 alternating red and white stripes, and a blue field of 13 white stars representing the American colonies.
Congress ultimately decided that a star would be added to our flag's constellation"" on the Fourth of July upon the admission of each new State to the union
In 1942, Congress passed the United States Flag Code, creating official standards for how we treat our beloved flag. From this code, we teach each new American generation to always show our flag the respect it deserves.
America's men and women in uniform have carried our flag into battle and given their lives to protect it. Our Star Spangled Banner flew above Fort McHenry in the Dawn's Early Light."" Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders carried it to victory at the Battle of San Juan Hill. And our heroic Marines raised it over Iwo Jima.""
Every day millions of American citizens raise it, salute it, and honor it on the home front. American workers hang Old Glory above factory floors where they proudly stamp their products Made in the USA"" and more and more products are being so stamped because our economy is starting to boom. We are doing really well.""
Companies are moving back into the United States and far fewer will be moving out. Believe me. And it's already happened. American schoolchildren put their hands on their hearts as they recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
Before watching a football game, you want to see those players be proud of their country. Respect our country. Respect our flag. And respect our national anthem and we think they will. We certainly hope they will.
When we honor the flag, we pay tribute to the men and women who have given everything for its defense. We renew the bonds of love and loyalty we owe to our fellow citizensâto every American who looks to the Stars and Stripes and sees woven into its fabric their past, their future, and their place in our great American family.
So this month, as we remember the patriots who fought to win our glorious Independence, let us renew our commitment to love our country, protect our citizens, and ensure that this will always be the land of the free and the home of the brave. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-10-13,Press Conference: Donald Trump Speaks To Reporters Before Marine One Departure,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-press-conference-marine-one-departure-october-13-2017,"What do you say to critics who say that you ending the CSRs, the subsidies under Obamacare, will throw the markets into chaos?
What it's going to do is it's going to be time to negotiate healthcare that's going to be good for everybody. That money is a subsidy for insurance companies. Take a look at their stocks. Look where they are. They're going through the roof, from past -- I donÃt know about today.
But the insurance companies that made a fortune, that money was a subsidy and almost, you could say, a payoff for insurance companies.
And what we have to do is come up with great healthcare. Now, that's what I did partially yesterday; that's going to cover a big segment. But now, for the rest, we have to come up with great -- whether it's going to be block grants or something else. And we just about have the votes.
Now, if the Democrats were smart, what they'd do is come and negotiate something where people could really get the kind of healthcare that they deserve, being citizens of our great country.
Mr. President, on the Iranian nuclear deal, why not just scrap it altogether now? You threatened to do so. Why not just end it now, withdraw?
Because we'll see what happens over the next short period of time. And I can do that instantaneously. I like a two-step process much better.
[Inaudible] healthcare?
Because I think what we'll do is we'll be able to renegotiate so that everybody gets to. We just took care of a big chunk, and now we'll take care of the other chunk. What would be nice -- if the Democratic leaders could come over to the White House, we'll negotiate some deal that's good for everybody. That's what I'd like.
But they're always a block vote against everything. They're like obstructionists. If they came over, maybe we could make a deal. But the subsidy is really a subsidy to the insurance company. That's not going to people; that's making the insurance companies rich.
Mr. President, you had said you were going to rip the Iran deal up, and you called it the worst ever.
Well, I may do that. I may do that. The deal is terrible. So what we've done is, through the certification process, we'll have Congress take a look at it, and I may very well do that. But I like a two-step process much better. John?
The moves that you've made on Obamacare here, with the executive order yesterday and then removing the subsidies --
We have great support.
-- is that a way for you to put pressure on Democrats and say, look, you're going to lose it -- come to the table and negotiate with them?
Well, they've already lost a big chunk, because as you know that's a big chunk and it's very popular. And you will have millions and millions of people sign up under that. You could say -- I mean, I'm not doing that consciously. I will say this, John -- I will say that the Democrats should come to me; I would even go to them.
Because I'm only interested in one thing: getting great healthcare for this country. That was a big chunk. And as far as the subsidy is concerned, I donÃt want to make the insurance companies rich.
If you look at their stock price over the last number of years, take a look at what's happened with those insurance companies. They're making a fortune by getting that kind of money.
How long will you give Rex Tillerson to get this new deal? And are strikes on Iran still a possibility if you donÃt get what you want?
We will see what happens with Iran. We're very unhappy with Iran. They have not treated us with the kind of respect that they should be treating. They should have thanked Barack Obama for making that deal. They were gone. They were economically gone.
He infused $100 [billion] to $150 billion into their economy. He gave them $1.7 billion in cash. And they should be, ""Thank you
On opioids, your wife is with you. She's been talking about the opioid crisis. You said you would declare a national emergency more than two months ago. What's taking so long?
We are studying national emergency right now. Believe it or not, doing national emergency, as you understand, is a very big statement.
We will be doing that. My wife, Melania, who happens to be right here, finds that subject to be of such vital importance, and she's very much involved. And as you know, she's on the committee and really wants to be involved in that process.
Have you spoken with Theresa May or Emmanuel Macron about the Iranian Deal?
Yes.
What did they say to you? What did you say to them?
They would love me to stay in, only for one reason: Look at the kind of money that's being sent. You know, Iran is spending money in various countries.
And I've always said it, and I say to them: Don't do anything. Don't worry about it. Take all the money you can get. They're all friends of mine.
Actually, Emmanuel called up, and he talked to me. And I said, look, Emmanuel, they just gave Renault a lot of money. Take their money; enjoy yourselves. But we'll see what happens.
Iran has to behave much differently.
You promised that you would help people who are struggling. The CSR payment looks like it will hurt low-income people.
The CSR payments, if you take a look at CSR payments, that money is going to insurance companies to prop up insurance companies.
To help lower-income people.
That money is going to insurance companies to lift up their stock price, and that's not what I'm about.
Take a look at who those insurance companies support, and I guarantee you one thing: It's not Donald Trump.
So you donÃt think it will raise premiums at all?
Mr. President, the JCPOA fix that's being floated by Senators Cotton, Corker, and Rubio that would remove the sunset provisions, strengthen IAEA inspections, do some other things. Does that meet the bar for you, or do you need more?
Well, I think we're going to take a look, John, at what happens. We're going to see what happens. We're going to see what they come back with. They may come back with something that's very satisfactory to me, and if they don't, within a very short period of time, I'll terminate the deal.
And as far as Puerto Rico is concerned, I love Puerto Rico.
[Inaudible] going down to Puerto Rico, and saying you won't stay there forever. You didn't say that about Texas or Louisiana. You said it about Puerto Rico. Why?
We've done a great job. We've done a great job in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has to get the infrastructure going. We're helping them with their infrastructure.
But most important on Puerto Rico is their electric plants are essentially gone. Now, they were gone before the hurricane; they were in bankruptcy, they owed $9 billion -- I think it was $9 billion. But the plants, as you know, were -- the electric was a disaster. After the storm, even more so.
We have to help them get the plants rebuilt. That's a long-term project, unfortunately. But we have to help them.
But I love the people of Puerto Rico, and we're going to help them.
On Puerto Rico, Mr. President, do you want to make sure that there remains a very bright line between hurricane relief and debt relief so that the two donÃt become so mingled?
Well, you have to watch -- you can't say there was a hurricane, and now we're going to spend X dollars. And we also have to do something with all the money that's been invested, mostly private.
The government is going to have to become before that money, because the government is going to want security. They're going to have to become before that money. And I'm sure we'll be able to work that out.
But the Puerto Rican people have tremendous spirit. When I was there and I looked at the way that -- what they have to go through. They have a lot of problems. We're going to help them straighten it out.
Could you clarify where you are on North Korea? You raised some eyebrows when you said this is ""the calm before the storm."""" What's next on North Korea?""
We're going to see what happens with North Korea. That's all I can say. We're going to see what happens. We're totally prepared for numerous things. We are going to see what happens with North Korea.
I will say, look, if something can happen where we negotiate, I'm always open to that. But if it's going to be something other than negotiation, believe me, we are ready, more so than we have ever been.
Thank you very much. Thank you."
2017-10-13,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses Iran Strategy,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-iran-strategy-october-13-2017,"Thank you very much. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. For this reason, upon taking office, I've ordered a complete strategic review of our policy toward the rogue regime in Iran. That review is now complete.
Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regimeÃs hostile actions and to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world.
Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worldÃs oldest and most vibrant nations, and spread death, destruction, and chaos all around the globe.
Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. The Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah twice bombed our embassy in Lebanon -- once in 1983 and again in 1984. Another Iranian-supported bombing killed 241 Americans -- service members they were, in their barracks in Beirut in 1983.
In 1996, the regime directed another bombing of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
Iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al QaedaÃs bombing of the American embassies in Kenya, Tanzania, and two years later, killing 224 people, and wounding more than 4,000 others.
The regime harbored high-level terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, including Osama bin LadenÃs son. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military personnel.
The Iranian dictatorshipÃs aggression continues to this day. The regime remains the worldÃs leading state sponsor of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist networks. It develops, deploys, and proliferates missiles that threaten American troops and our allies.
It harasses American ships and threatens freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and in the Red Sea. It imprisons Americans on false charges. And it launches cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure, financial system, and military.
The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorshipÃs long campaign of bloodshed. The regime violently suppresses its own citizens; it shot unarmed student protestors in the street during the Green Revolution.
This regime has fueled sectarian violence in Iraq, and vicious civil wars in Yemen and Syria. In Syria, the Iranian regime has supported the atrocities of Bashar al-AssadÃs regime and condoned AssadÃs use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children.
Given the regimeÃs murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future. The regimeÃs two favorite chants are ÃDeath to AmericaÃ and ÃDeath to Israel.Ã
Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States and the United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop IranÃs pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
But the previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries. We need negotiators who will much more strongly represent AmericaÃs interest.
The nuclear deal threw IranÃs dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created. It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100 billion dollars its government could use to fund terrorism.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, a large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into Iran. Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash. I wonder where all that money went.
Worst of all, the deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program. And importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in IranÃs path to nuclear weapons.
What is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays IranÃs nuclear capability for a short period of time? This, as President of the United States, is unacceptable. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time.
The saddest part of the deal for the United States is that all of the money was paid up front, which is unheard of, rather than at the end of the deal when they have shown theyÃve played by the rules. But whatÃs done is done, and that's why we are where we are.
The Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.
The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites, even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of IranÃs clandestine nuclear weapons program.
There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea. I am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed.
By its own terms, the Iran Deal was supposed to contribute to Ãregional and international peace and security.Ã And yet, while the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and beyond. Importantly, Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.
So today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by Iran, and after extensive consultations with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of IranÃs destructive actions.
First, we will work with our allies to counter the regimeÃs destabilizing activity and support for terrorist proxies in the region.
Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
Third, we will address the regimeÃs proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
And finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.
Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
The execution of our strategy begins with the long-overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on IranÃs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian Supreme LeaderÃs corrupt personal terror force and militia.
It has hijacked large portions of IranÃs economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, D.C.
I am authorizing the Treasury Department to further sanction the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support for terrorism and to apply sanctions to its officials, agents, and affiliates.
I urge our allies to join us in taking strong actions to curb Iran's continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior, including thorough sanctions outside the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
Finally, on the grave matter of IranÃs nuclear program: Since the signing of the nuclear agreement, the regime's dangerous aggression has only escalated. At the same time, it has received massive sanctions relief while continuing to develop its missiles program. Iran has also entered into lucrative business contracts with other parties to the agreement.
When the agreement was finalized in 2015, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to ensure that CongressÃs voice would be heard on the deal.
Among other conditions, this law requires the President, or his designee, to certify that the suspension of sanctions under the deal is Ãappropriate and proportionateÃ to measure -- and other measures taken by Iran to terminate its illicit nuclear program. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of IranÃs nuclear breakout.
That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the dealÃs many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. These include the dealÃs sunset clauses that, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on IranÃs nuclear program.
The flaws in the deal also include insufficient enforcement and near total silence on IranÃs missile programs. Congress has already begun the work to address these problems.
Key House and Senate leaders are drafting legislation that would amend the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to strengthen enforcement, prevent Iran from developing an inter- -- this is so totally important -- an intercontinental ballistic missile, and make all restrictions on IranÃs nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. So important. I support these initiatives.
However, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review, and our participation can be cancelled by me, as President, at any time.
As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the worse that threat becomes. It is why we are determined that the worldÃs leading sponsor of terrorism will never obtain nuclear weapons.
In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regimeÃs longest-suffering victims: its own people. The citizens of Iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders.
The Iranian people long to -- and they just are longing, to reclaim their countryÃs proud history, its culture, its civilization, its cooperation with its neighbors.
We hope that these new measures directed at the Iranian dictatorship will compel the government to reevaluate its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East Ã- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own citizens.
We pray for a future where young children -- American and Iranian, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish -- can grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
And, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep America safe.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you."

Thank you very much. You know, I've been here before. [Laughter] You do know that. Before the big day on November 8th, I was here.
I want to thank Mark Meadows and all of the folks that have really made this possible. And, Tony, tremendous guy.
We have some incredible people that we love and that we're involved with. So we all know that. And I'm being followed by Mr. Bennett -- you know that, right? And I've been watching him say nice things about me before I knew him. Those are the ones I like -- [Laughter] -- where they speak well of you before you know them. Right?
But I really want to thank everybody, and, Tony, for your extraordinary leadership of this organization. And I want to thank, also, Lawana, for your dedication to the faith community and to our nation. Work so hard.
It's great to be back here with so many friends at the 2017 Values Voter Summit, and we know what that means. [Applause] We know what that means. America is a nation of believers, and together we are strengthened and sustained by the power of prayer. [Applause]
As we gather for this tremendous event, our hearts remain sad and heavy for the victims of the horrific mass murder last week in Las Vegas. It was an act of pure evil.
But in the wake of such horror, we also witnessed the true character of our nation. A mother laid on top of her daughter to shield her from gunfire. A husband died to protect his beloved wife. Strangers rescued strangers, police officers -- and you saw that, all of those incredible police officers, how brave they were, how great they were running into fire.
[Applause] And first responders, they rushed right into danger.
Americans defied evil and hatred with courage and love.
The men and women who risked their lives to save their fellow citizens gave proof to the words of this scripture: ""The light shines in the darkness
All of America is praying for the wounded and the grieving, and we will be with them today and we will be with them forever. [Applause] Just want to finish by saying that -- really, and we understand it was so horrific to watch and so terrible -- but to those who lost the ones they love: We know that we cannot erase your pain, but we promise to never, ever leave your side. We are one nation, and we all hurt together, we hope together, and we heal together. [Applause]
We also stand with the millions of people who have suffered from the massive fires, which are right now raging in California, and the catastrophic hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands. And I will tell you, I left Texas, and I left Florida, and I left Louisiana, and I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president [governor] of the Virgin Islands.
These are people that are incredible people. They've suffered gravely, and we'll be there. We're going to be there. We have, really -- it's not even a question of a choice.
We don't even want a choice. We're going to be there as Americans, and we love those people and what they've gone through. And they're all healing, and their states and territories are healing, and they're healing rapidly.
In the wake of the terrible tragedies of the past several weeks, the American people have responded with goodness and generosity, and bravery. You've seen it. The heroism of everyday citizens reminds us that the true strength of our nation is found in the hearts and souls of our people.
When America is unified, no force on Earth can break us apart. [Applause] We love our families. We love our neighbors. We love our country.
Everyone here today is brought together by the same shared and timeless values. We cherish the sacred dignity of every human life. [Applause]
We believe in strong families and safe communities. We honor the dignity of work. [Applause] We defend our Constitution. We protect religious liberty.
[Applause] We treasure our freedom. We are proud of our history. We support the rule of law and the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] We celebrate our heroes, and we salute every American who wears the uniform.
[Applause]
We respect our great American flag. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And we stand united behind the customs, beliefs and traditions that define who we are as a nation and as a people.
George Washington said that ""religion and morality are indispensable"""" to America's happiness
The American Founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence -- four times. [Applause] How times have changed. But you know what, now they're changing back again. Just remember that.
[Applause]
Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer.
Religious liberty is enshrined in the very first amendment of the Bill of Rights. And we all pledge allegiance to -- very, very beautifully -- ""one nation under God."""" [Applause]""
This is America's heritage, a country that never forgets that we are all -- all, every one of us -- made by the same God in Heaven. [Applause]
When I came to speak with you last year, I made you a promise. Well, one of the promises I made you was that I'd come back. See? [Applause] And I don't even need your vote this year, right? That's even nicer. [Laughter]
But I pledged that, in a Trump administration, our nation's religious heritage would be cherished, protected, and defended like you have never seen before. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. You see it every day.
You're reading it.
So this morning I am honored and thrilled to return as the first sitting President to address this incredible gathering of friends -- so many friends. [Applause] So many friends. And I'll ask Tony and all our people that do such a great job in putting this event together -- can I take next year off or not? [Laughter] Or do I have to be back? I don't know. [Audience Yells No]
He's saying -- they're saying no. Lawana is saying no. That's means no. [Laughter]
So I'm here to thank you for your support and to share with you how we are delivering on that promise, defending our shared values, and in so doing, how we are renewing the America we love.
In the last 10 months, we have followed through on one promise after another. [Applause] I didn't have a schedule, but if I did have a schedule, I would say we are substantially ahead of schedule. [Applause]
Some of those promises are to support and defend the Constitution. I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice in the mold of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, the newest member of the Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch. [Applause]
To protect the unborn, I have reinstated a policy first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, the Mexico City Policy. [Applause] To protect religious liberty, including protecting groups like this one, I signed a new executive action in a beautiful ceremony at the White House on our National Day of Prayer -- [Applause] -- which day we made official. [Applause]
Among many historic steps, the executive order followed through on one of my most important campaign promises to so many of you: to prevent the horrendous Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights. [Applause] Thank you. We will not allow government workers to censor sermons or target our pastors or our ministers or rabbis. These are the people we want to hear from, and they're not going to be silenced any longer.
[Applause]
Just last week, based on this executive action, the Department of Justice issued a new guidance to all federal agencies to ensure that no religious group is ever targeted under my administration. It won't happen. [Applause]
We have also taken action to protect the conscience rights of groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. You know what they went through. [Applause] What they went through -- they were going through hell. And then all of the sudden they won.
They said, how did that happen? [Laughter]
We want to really point out that the Little Sisters of the Poor and other people of faith, they live by a beautiful calling, and we will not let bureaucrats take away that calling or take away their rights. [Applause]
We are stopping cold the attacks on Judeo-Christian values. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. And something I've said so much during the last two years, but I'll say it again as we approach the end of the year.
You know, we're getting near that beautiful Christmas season that people don't talk about anymore. [Laughter] They don't use the word ""Christmas"""" because it's not politically correct. You go to department stores
Well, guess what? We're saying ""Merry Christmas"""" again. [Applause]""
And as a Christmas gift to all of our hardworking families, we hope Congress will pass massive tax cuts for the American people. [Applause] That includes increasing the child tax credit and expanding it to eliminate the marriage penalty. [Applause] Because we know that the American family is the true bedrock of American life. So true.
[Applause] This is such an exciting event because we are really working very hard, and hopefully Congress will come through.
You saw what we did yesterday with respect to healthcare. It's step by step by step. [Applause] And that was a very big step yesterday. Another big step was taken the day before yesterday.
And one by one it's going to come down, and we're going to have great healthcare in our country. We're going to have great healthcare in our country. [Applause] We're taking a little different route than we had hoped, because getting Congress -- they forgot what their pledges were. [Laughter] So we're going a little different route.
But you know what? In the end, it's going to be just as effective, and maybe it will even be better. [Applause]
For too long, politicians have tried to centralize the authority among the hands of a small few in our nation's capital. Bureaucrats think they can run your lives, overrule your values, meddle in your faith, and tell you how to live, what to say, and how to pray. But we know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children and create a thriving society. [Applause]
We know that faith and prayer, not federal regulation -- and, by the way, we are cutting regulations at a clip that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody. [Applause] In nine months, we have cut more regulation than any President has cut during their term in office. So we are doing the job.
[Applause] And that is one of the major reasons, in addition to the enthusiasm for manufacturing and business and jobs -- and the jobs are coming back.
That's one of the major reasons -- regulation, what we've done -- that the stock market has just hit an all-time historic high. [Applause] That just on the public markets we've made, since Election Day, $5.2 trillion in value. Think of that: $5.2 trillion. [Applause]
And as you've seen, the level of enthusiasm is the highest it's ever been, and we have a 17-year low in unemployment. So we're doing, really, some work. [Applause]
We know that it's the family and the church, not government officials, that know best how to create strong and loving communities. [Applause] And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government -- we worship God. [Applause] Inspired by that conviction, we are returning moral clarity to our view of the world and the many grave challenges we face.
This afternoon, in a little while, I'll be giving a speech on Iran, a terrorist nation like few others. And I think you're going to find it very interesting. [Applause]
Yesterday, things happened with Pakistan, and I have openly said Pakistan took tremendous advantage of our country for many years, but we're starting to have a real relationship with Pakistan and they're starting to respect us as a nation again, and so are other nations. They're starting to respect the United States of America again, and I appreciate that. [Applause] And I want to thank the leaders of Pakistan for what they've been doing.
In this administration, we will call evil by its name. [Applause] We stand with our friends and allies, we forge new partnerships in pursuit of peace, and we take decisive action against those who would threaten our people with harm. [Applause] And we will be decisive -- because we know that the first duty of government is to serve its citizens. We are defending our borders, protecting our workers, and enforcing our laws.
You see it every single day like you haven't seen it in many, many years -- if you've seen it at all. [Applause]
In protecting America's interests abroad, we will always support our cherished friend and partner, the State of Israel. [Applause] We will confront the dangers that imperil our nation, our allies, and the world, including the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. [Applause]
We have made great strides against ISIS -- tremendous strides. I don't know if you've seen what's going on, but tremendous strides against ISIS. They never got hit like this before. [Laughter, Audience Member Calls Out] Stand up. Stand up. Let me see -- he's a rough guy. I can see it.
But they've been just ruthless and they've ruthlessly slaughtered innocent Christians, along with the vicious killing of innocent Muslims and other religious minorities. And we've made their lives very, very difficult -- believe me. [Applause]
We've done more against ISIS in nine months than the previous administration has done during its whole administration -- by far, by far. [Applause] And ISIS is now being dealt one defeat after another
We are confronting rogue regimes from Iran to North Korea, and we are challenging the communist dictatorship of Cuba and the socialist oppression of Venezuela. And we will not lift the sanctions on these repressive regimes until they restore political and religious freedom for their people. [Applause]
All of these bad actors share a common enemy, the one force they cannot stop, the force deep within our souls, and that is the power of hope. That is why, in addition to our great military might, our enemies truly fear the United States. Because our people never lose faith, never give in, and always hope for a better tomorrow.
Last week, Melania and I were reminded of this in a powerful way when we traveled to Las Vegas. We visited a hospital where some of the survivors were recovering from absolutely horrific wounds. We met a young man named Brady Cook. He's 22 and a brand-new police officer.
That night was Brady's second day in field training -- his second day as a policeman, can you believe that? But when the shooting began, he did not hesitate. He acted with incredible courage, rushing into the hail of bullets, and he was badly shot in the shoulder.
This is what Brady said: ""I didn't expect it
Several weeks before, when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, a local furniture storeowner, who's known in Texas as ""Mattress Mack
He brought them back to his stores, and gave them food and a clean, dry place to stay, even if it meant ruining countless dollars' worth of furniture.
As ""Mattress Mack"""" put it
In Brady and Mack, we see the strength of the American spirit. This spirit of courage and compassion is all around us, every day. It is the heartbeat of our great nation. And despite certain coverage, that beat is stronger than it's ever been before.
You see right through it. [Applause] That beat is stronger than it's ever been.
We see this spirit in the men and women who selflessly enlist in our armed forces and, really, who go out and risk their lives for God and for country. And we see it in the mothers and the fathers who get up at the crack of dawn; they work two jobs and sometimes three jobs. They sacrifice every day for the furniture and -- future of their children. They have to go out.
They go out. They work. The future of their children is everything to them. They put it before everything.
And they make sure that the future of their children has God involved in it. So important to them. [Applause]
We see it in the church communities that come together to care for one another, to pray for each other, and to stand strong with each other in times of need.
The people who grace our lives, and fill our homes, and build our communities are the true strength of our nation, and the greatest hope for a better tomorrow.
As long as we have pride in our country, confidence in our future, and faith in our God, then America will prevail.
We will defeat every evil, overcome every threat, and meet every single challenge. We will defend our faith and protect our traditions. We will find the best in each other and in ourselves. We will pass on the blessings of liberty, and the glories of God, to our children.
Our values will endure, our nation will thrive, our citizens will flourish, and our freedom will triumph.
Thank you to the Value Voter Summit. Such an incredible group of people you are. Thank you to all of the faithful here today. And thank you to the people of faith all across our nation and all over the world.
May God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. [Applause]"
2017-10-11,"Speech: Donald Trump Delivers a Speech on Tax Reform in Harrisburg, PA","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-tax-reform-harrisburg-october-11-2017,"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It's great to be back in Pennsylvania with the proud men and women of the American Trucking Associations. [Applause] We love Pennsylvania, and we love our great truckers. [Applause]
I also want to thank all of our wonderful members of Congress who are here with us today. Should I read their names? Yes? [Applause] Then I will.
Representative Lou Barletta, great guy, running for governor. [Applause] He's running for the Senate. He's running for the -- where's Lou? So, I heard he was running for governor, but then I heard he was running for the Senate. He's going to win. You're going to win big. You're going to win big, Lou. Good luck. [Applause]
A friend of mine for a long time, Representative Mike Kelly. [Applause] Thank you, Mike. Tom Marino -- going to be the drug czar. He's going to do a great job. Tom Marino. [Applause] Thank you, Tom. He's going to be amazing. The drug czar.
Patrick Meehan. Patrick. [Applause] Thank you, Patrick. Scott Perry. [Applause] Scott. And Lloyd Smucker. [Applause] Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd.
I also want to thank a couple of very special people. They've been fantastic in what they've done. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, who is here someplace. [Applause] And Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council. Thank you, Gary. Thank you. [Applause]
And Mike Turzai, the Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Thank you, Mike. [Applause] I think that's enough, right? That's enough. [Applause, Laughter] We'll start losing the crowd, Mike.
Before we begin, I want to take a moment to address some of the recent tragedies that have struck our incredible nation. In the darkest moments, the light of our people has shown through like seldom before -- their goodness, their courage, and their love. No destructive force on Earth is more powerful than the strength and resilience of the American people. [Applause]
We are praying for all of the families affected by the horrific mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas. We grieve with you, and we will never leave your side.
Our hearts are also with the victims of the wildfires in California's Napa and Sonoma valleys -- and they are wild and dangerous fires. And we have FEMA out there right now, along with a lot of first responders doing an incredible job with everybody else. And they really have done a really incredible -- and it's a very dangerous job. My FEMA people are incredible -- incredible. [Applause]
We have issued a disaster declaration and are working closely with state government. The recovery effort is fully underway for those impacted by the recent catastrophic hurricanes.
Through these difficult times, we have witnessed the unbreakable spirit of our nation. Together, we will restore, rebuild, and return stronger than ever before. That's what's happening. [Applause]
We are here today to discuss our vision for America's economic revival, which has already started. It started on November 8th. [Applause] We want lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American truckers and for American workers. It's happening. [Applause]
Nothing gets done in America without the hardworking men and women of the trucking industry. Do we agree with that? Do we agree? [Applause] Thank you so much -- job you do.
When your trucks are moving, America is growing. Do you agree? [Applause] That is why my administration has taken historic steps to remove the barriers that have slowed you down. America first means putting American truckers first. [Applause]
Since January of this year, we have slashed job-killing red tape all across our economy. We have stopped or eliminated more regulations in the last eight months than any President has done during an entire term. [Applause] It's not even close.
That includes eliminating the regulations that drive up the cost of energy. We want low-cost fuel for our truckers and for our families all across this country. And we are just getting started, believe me -- just getting started. [Applause]
I've ordered every agency across the federal government to review and then remove the regulations that destroy your jobs, hamstring your companies, and undermine your ability to compete.
My administration is also committed to passing a historic infrastructure package that will generate $1 trillion to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure with a special focus on roadways and highways. [Applause]
It is time to take care of our country, to rebuild our communities, and to protect our great American workers. It's about time. [Applause]And already, we are seeing the incredible results. Results that, in many cases, the media hates to report. But I'll report them tonight for you. [Applause]
Unemployment is at a 16-year low. [Applause] Wages are rising -- and you know you haven't heard that in a long time. [Applause] The stock market is soaring to record levels, boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hardworking Americans. Their values are going up every single day. [Applause]
And very proudly, just in the stock market alone, we have increased our economic worth by $5.2 trillion dollars. That's right since Election Day -- $5.2 trillion. [Applause]
Think about that. That's a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. So we've already -- but listen to this because we've doubled -- in the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled, so that in eight years our debt -- literally hundreds of years of debt -- doubled in eight years to $20 trillion.
But since the election on November 8th, I've increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. [Applause] You haven't heard those numbers.
GDP growth reached more than 3.1 percent last quarter -- way ahead of schedule. We weren't supposed to hit that number for a long time. [Applause] Not for a long time. And I will tell you, I think this quarter would have even been better, but we did get hit with some very, very powerful hurricanes. But it's still going to be very good.
Manufacturing confidence is at an all-time high, which is great news for those who ship products to the marketplace. The confidence in our country is back like it hasn't been in many, many years. [Applause]
The fact is, America is finally back on the right track. But our country, and our economy, cannot take off like they should unless we transform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code. [Applause]
And that's why I'm here with you right now, tonight. Thank you. And we're going to fight, and we're going to get those Republicans and maybe of few of those Democrats to raise their hand. And you're going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country and this great economy. [Applause]
That is why we have proposed tax cuts that are pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American. [Applause] We need a tax system that is fair to working families and that encourages companies to stay in America, grow in America, spend in America, and hire in America. [Applause]
Throughout the year, my administration has worked closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform that will deliver exactly that: more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-income families and for American businesses of all size. [Applause] Our tax reform framework will achieve our four core principles:
First, we will cut taxes for everyday, hardworking Americans. [Applause] Under our framework, the first $12,000 for a single individual and the first $24,000 for a married couple, will be tax free. No tax at all. [Applause]
And remember, you'll do your tax on a single piece of paper. [Applause] H&R Block will not like Donald Trump very much. That's one company, I will tell you -- they will not like me at all. And that's okay. We are nearly doubling the amount of income that based at the zero bracket.
In other words, as the Democrats say -- and do they say untruths -- you look at what's happened, they're not telling you the truth. Because they pretend there isn't a zero rate. And there is, and it's expanding very substantially under my plan. They don't show the zero rate. So they go, oh, 15 percent, or 12 percent against 15. But it's not. It's 12 percent against zero.
You take a look at the categories. So we're bringing it down, remember, from eight brackets to four. But they're forgetting to use the zero bracket, which truly is deceptive. Do we agree with that? [Applause] It's truly very deceptive.
Under our framework, we make the zero bracket bigger and get rid of the 10 percent bracket, and we're reducing the 15 percent rate down to 12 percent. So that's a massive amount of money. [Applause]
So the rates are coming down to 0, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent -- all big beneficiaries from what you have now. Big beneficiaries from what there is like you haven't seen before.
Joining us today is Susi Schlomann, a retiree who recently moved to Pennsylvania from Queens, New York. Well, I like both places. I like Pennsylvania; I grew up in Queens. [Applause] Went to school in Pennsylvania. Like them both. Where's Susi? Where are you, Susi? Where's Susi? Hi, Susi. How are you doing? You're going to be happy with this, right? Because you know what I'm going to say. Thanks, Susi.
And Susi says that high taxes are forcing seniors like her to make painful cuts and cutbacks during the golden years of their lives. Best years of their lives. She hopes Congress will pass our framework so we can help more American seniors make ends meet on a fixed income.
We must honor and respect -- [Applause] -- the people whose decades of hard work helped to build our country and to make our country great. But we're going to make our country greater than it's ever been before. That's what's happening. [Applause]
Our framework also provides relief to those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one through a $500 tax credit. So important, and so many people have wanted it. And we will substantially increase the child tax credit to save working families even more money. [Applause]
The single most important investment our country can make is in our children. The strength of our nation is determined by the strength of our families, and we are committed to helping parents make starting and raising a family more affordable.
Also with us today is Laureen Cummings, a mother of four who owns a small staffing company that provides private nursing services and at-home care. Laureen. Where's Laureen? Hello, Laureen. [Applause]
Laureen says that if Congress passes tax relief and reform, she will be able to create more high-paying jobs for healthcare workers in the Scranton area. That's an area that we love, I will tell you that. [Applause]
Our framers framework will unlock the American dream for millions of our fellow citizens. By eliminating tax breaks and special interest loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, our framework ensures that the benefits of tax reform go to the middle class, not to the highest earners.
It's a middle-class bill. That's what we're thinking of. That's what I want. I've had rich friends of mine come up to me, and say, Donald, you're doing this tax plan -- we don't want anything. We don't. Now, they gain when the economy gains. They gain when companies get better. They gain in lots of different ways.
But they don't want that. So many people have come up to me and say, give it to the middle class. Give it to people that need it. Give it to people that want to spend it. You would be surprised.
Bob Kraft, he owns the New England Patriots, good guy, does very well. Good guy. He does a great job. He was at the White House recently. He gave me a Super Bowl ring. I was very honored. [Applause] I was very honored.
And as he's leaving the White House, he said, Donald, I know you're very soon going to be doing tax reform and tax cuts. Give it to the middle class. Don't give it to us. Give it to the middle class. And that's what we're trying so hard to do. And you will see how good this is. [Applause] So important. It is so important. The second plank of our tax framework is to make the tax code more simple, fair, and easy to understand.
American families and businesses waste billions of hours, and tens of billions of dollars, on excruciating paperwork -- you see that, I mean it's all over the place, and you have no idea what you're doing anyway -- and compliance every single year. Massive numbers of paper. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on that same single sheet of paper that I'm so proud of talking about. [Applause]
As part of the effort to make our tax system simple and fair, we are going to protect thousands of family businesses by ending the crushing, horrible, and unfair estate tax, sometimes known as the death tax. [Applause] That's a tax that has destroyed so many businesses and kept those businesses out of your family, your children, your grandchildren. It's very sad. But we are working to end the estate tax, to end the death tax, as it's often called. [Applause]
In the crowd today, we have Calvin Ewell and his son, Steve. Calvin. Where's Calvin? Where is Calvin? [Applause] Good-looking family. The Ewells has been a trucking business and in the trucking business since 1946, a very good year. [Applause] It's a great year. I love that year. Trucking runs in their blood, and Calvin wants to pass his company along to his children, just as it was passed down to him by his father.
We are going to protect small businesses owners and their families so they can continue to run their companies with dedication and with love. [Applause] And we will make taxes simple, and easy, and fair for all Americans. [Applause] Thank you, Calvin.
Calvin, you want to hand that business down, right? But you know, don't worry about it for about 40 year, I hope, okay? 4-0 -- long time. Right? Let's keep him around. Thank you, Calvin. [Applause] Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and to create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.
The last major tax reform was passed more than 30 years ago in 1986, with a large bipartisan majority. I mean, it was a bipartisan bill. That would be wonderful. But sadly, the Democrats have become obstructionists. They want to stop. They don't want to do anything productive. They want to raise your taxes very, very substantially.
I mean, I won't even talk about open borders and higher taxes. That's not a good combination to get elected, believe me. But it's open borders and high taxes, but they are good at obstruction. The 1986 tax bill substantially reduced our corporate tax rates to make America globally competitive. The plan worked, and jobs and industry boomed.
Other countries saw our success however and they copied our playbook. Our foreign competitors adopted tax rates much lower than ours and much more competitive, and all of the sudden, they started taking our businesses away from us.
In fact, when it comes to the business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations. Our rate is the least competitive rate. We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world. How foolish is this?
Our business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average economic competitor. The current system has placed a massive tax on every product made in America. Remember the expression, ""Made in the USA
What do you like better -- ""Made in America"""" or """"Made in the USA""""? Ready? Made in America. [Applause] Made in the USA. [Applause] Seems to be -- hi
But giving so many countries a tremendous advantage over us -- if you look at China at 15 percent, and Mexico -- all of these countries has a lower tax rate than the United States. You can't compete that way.
It is time to end this unfair disadvantage and to give American companies and workers the level playing field they so richly deserve, finally. [Applause]
Because when American truckers -- and I mean these great, great people. These are great heroes. If they have a level playing field, there's nobody on Earth with trucks or any other way that can beat you folks. There's nobody. I know what you go through. There is nobody that can beat you. Nobody. [Applause]
But you finally have a government -- and frankly, you finally have somebody that has given up a lot. My other life was very good. I have to be -- I had a very good life. [Applause] I had a very good life. But you know what, I'm having a better life now, and I'm helping a lot of people, and that's as far as I'm concerned. [Applause]
And believe me, I love doing this because we're doing so much, between the regulations and the taxes and the getting a Supreme Court judge not just nominated but getting him onto the Supreme Court -- Justice Gorsuch, who is doing a great, great job at the Supreme Court -- and appointing so many other great judges throughout the country. [Applause] It was so important. They were so important. So I appreciate that.
But you finally have a government that is going to defend you and stand up for you and your country. [Applause] America is being respected again. Something happened today where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news.
And one of my generals came in, they said, you know, I have to tell you, a year ago they would have never done that. It was a great sign of respect. You'll probably be hearing about it over the next few days. But this is a country that did not respect us. This is a country that respects us now. The world is starting to respect us again, believe me. [Applause]
Under our new framework, you will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and workers can win against those foreign competitors who are winning, in many cases, because they have an unfair advantage. We will cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent and more, all the way down to no more than 20 percent -- below the average of our major competitors from other countries. [Applause]
The biggest winners from this transformation will be everyday families, from all backgrounds, from all walks of life, and our great companies, which will produce the jobs. They are going to produce jobs like you've never seen before.
When companies leave our shores, it's the American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and move to America, it's our wonderful workers who reap the rewards, including our great truckers who will have more products to deliver and more contracts to fill. That's the way it happens. [Applause]
For the many American truckers who file taxes as sole-proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap your top tax rate at a maximum of 25 percent -- substantially lower than what you're paying now. [Applause]
The more than 30 million Americans who have small businesses will see -- listen to this -- a 40 percent cut in their marginal tax rate -- 40 percent. [Applause] I wouldn't want to be a politician against that. [Laughter] They're going to have a long, hard winter.
This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-sized businesses in more than 80 years. Not since 1931 have they had taxes anywhere near that level, right? [Applause]
This huge -- [Laughter] -- tax cut -- two words, ""huge"""" and now """"rocket."""" Can you believe it? I have [Inaudible] Rocket! You know what we're talking about
With us today is Kevin Burch of Jet Express, who has been in the trucking business for more than 40 years. Where is he? Kevin? [Applause] Forty years? You don't look that old, Kevin. Good. Good job.
Kevin says that if Congress passes our tax relief and reform plan, he will be able to invest in new equipment and additional training for his dockworkers, drivers, and technicians. He wants to create more American jobs, and we are working to help him do exactly that. Plus, we're working on a tax write-off that will be almost immediate with your investment. That's something that you've never seen before. [Applause]
And that's part of our plan because companies, in order to compete over the next five-year period, allows our framework and within our framework, that you write-off 100 percent of the cost of new equipment in the year you buy it. When have you heard that one? [Applause] That's going to be a big one. That's going to be big.
I've had calls from great, great businesspeople. They said, Mr. President, did you really say that? I said, yes, I did. And I might say, they do call me now, ""Mr. President."""" It's very interesting. I've had friends for years
It's weird. I say, will you please loosen up? All of these are friends for 30 years, and they get a little bit tight. But they are impressed with the one-year immediate write off. That's what they're impressed by. I think they're very impressed.
We want our companies to invest and expand, because that means more jobs, more products rolling off the assembly line, and more truckers delivering those products to stores all across our country. Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas. [Applause] Trillions of dollars.
Our current tax code actually punishes companies for keeping their headquarters in America. You see that. That's happening. They're being punished. It discourages them from bringing back the profits they earn overseas.
In 2016, American multinational companies kept 71 percent of their foreign-earned profits overseas and away from our country. Our framework will totally reverse this, and it's a very, very troubling trend. We'll be bringing back, probably, very close to 100 percent of the money back into our country where it can be put to work, and jobs will be created. [Applause]
We will totally eliminate the penalty on returning future earnings back to the United States. And we will impose a one-time low tax on money currently parked overseas so it can be brought back home to America where it belongs, and where it can do its job. [Applause]
My Council of Economic Advisers estimates that this change, along with a lower tax rate, would likely give the typical American household a $4,000 pay raise. [Applause] Could be a lot more than that, too. You haven't heard this. So about a $4,000 amount of money additional for the American family to spend. That's very exciting.
And you're going to spend that money, it's going to be put to work, and jobs are going to be produced, and we're going to start making our product again. Wouldn't that be nice? It's going to happen. [Applause]
And by the way, not as part of our tax plan, but I am right now renegotiating trade deals that are so horrendous and so one-sided and so embarrassing for our country. We are -- you're probably reading in the papers -- renegotiating NAFTA. We're renegotiating -- [Applause] -- various other deals with foreign countries that are so embarrassing and so horrendous that you would say, why on Earth would anybody have signed a deal like that?
I'll also be announcing, as you know, my statement and what we'll be doing with respect to the Iran Deal, speaking of badly negotiated deals.
Booo --
We're doing that very shortly. [Applause] So to summarize: Our plan goes from eight tax brackets down to four; expands the zero tax bracket greatly; expands the child tax credit; repeals the estate tax and special interest tax breaks; cuts the corporate tax rate from much more and equal to 35 percent tax, and brings it down all the way down to 20 percent; and cuts tax rates for small businesses to the lowest level in more than 80 years. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
And our great congressmen, congresswomen, and all of the people that we're working with, all I can say is: You better get it passed. [Applause] They will. I know. And you have great ones here in Pennsylvania.
For too long, our tax code has incentivized companies to leave our country in search of lower tax rates. My administration rejects the offshoring model, and we have embraced a brand new model. It's called the American model. [Applause]
We want companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for the American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. We're involved in all over the world. It's now time we get involved with rebuilding our country. [Applause]
No one knows America better than America's truckers. Every single day, from coast to coast and border to border -- where we will have a wall, by the way. In case you had any doubt. Does anybody have a doubt?
No!
These guys don't have a doubt. In our largest cities and across the rolling plains, you see the incredible beauty of our natural wonders. You see things that few people see. In fact, I think you should take a major wage reduction, you have such a beautiful thing. [Laughter]
And we see the enduring strength of the American spirit in those same truckers. What you see is incredible every day. What you see are things that nobody else sees. And I want to tell you, to the truckers in this room, which is a lot of people: you're going to make more money, you're going to do better than ever before, and we truly admire you. You are our heroes. Believe me. You are our heroes. [Applause]
Over the decades, you have also seen the disastrous consequences of economic surrender. Our politicians surrendered. They gave up our country. You've driven past the shuttered factories, watched thriving communities become ghost towns, and witnessed America's wealth get shipped away to foreign lands.
Now is our chance to reclaim America's destiny. We can breathe new life into struggling industries and forgotten towns. We can end the special deals for special interests, and we will honor the hardworking, patriotic Americans who make this country run. [Applause]
And you can help us stock the store shelves all across the country, and around the world, with more products stamped with those beautiful words, that we're going to say it this way: Made in the USA. [Applause] We will lift our fellow citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. [Applause]
American goods will sail across the oceans, American trucks will glide along our highways -- so beautiful will those highways be -- smooth, beautiful, no potholes. [Applause] I know. No potholes.
I have many friends in the trucking business, and they tell me it's never been like this. They'll buy beautiful new equipment. By the time it goes from Los Angeles to New York and back, they have a big renovation job on their hands. They said they've never seen it like this before. They will be beautiful again. They will be smooth, beautiful, highways again. [Applause]
The American flag -- do we love our American flag? [Applause] Right? I think people forgot how patriotic we are. I think people forgot how much we love our country. They've learned over the last week, haven't they? [Applause]
But American flags will soar high above the roads. Our cities and our towns will proudly display that flag. Our children will be raised in homes filled with love, communities filled with airplanes that are going back and forth -- that's okay -- but communities filled with hope, and a nation filled with pride.
We will build this future together, as one people and one nation under God. [Applause]
With your help, and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams. [Applause]
This is a great and proud state. I am so honored to be with you tonight. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-10-06,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-october-6-2017,"My fellow Americans. On Wednesday, I traveled to Las Vegas to visit with the victims of the horrific shooting, speak with their families, and thank the brave citizens, first responders and medical personnel, who saved so many lives.
We struggled to grasp the evil that occurred on Sunday evening, when a murderer shot into a crowd of more than 20,000 people. Men, women, and children were gathered to enjoy a concert. They never imagined it would become the worst day of their lives.
But in the wake of such shock and horror, it was a matter of seconds before the goodness of the human spirit broke through.
When the shooting began, a mother laid on top of her daughter to shield her from gunfire. A husband died to protect his beloved wife. Strangers rescued strangers. Police officers and first responders rushed into danger.
When the worst of humanity strikes, the best of humanity responds. The men and women who risk their lives to save their fellow citizens give proof to the words of this scripture: the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
Americans defied death and hatred with love and courage. This week, our nation remembers all the wonderful people we have lost, and all of the grace they brought into our lives and our communities
Among the fallen were young students full of limitless potential, law-enforcement personnel, a nurse, teachers dedicated to our children's future, and many others. They were mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers. They were husbands and wives and sons and daughters.
They will be dearly missed and they will never be forgotten. To all those who lost a loved one: we cannot imagine your pain or erase your sorrow. Our hearts grieve for you. We stand with you now and every day after, and we pray that God may carry you through the anguish and sorrow.
We can never fill the void of those who perished, but we pledge to honor them by living as they would have wished, with lives full of purpose, with hearts full of love and with hope for a better tomorrow. May God comfort the brokenhearted, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you."
2017-09-29,Press Conference: Donald Trump Speaks at a Press Gaggle on the South Lawn,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-press-conference-gaggle-september-29-2017,"Mr. President, are you going to take action on Mr. Price?
We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.
Mr. President, what about your other Cabinet members? Did you order a review?
We'll see. I mean, we have -- he's a very fine man, but we're going to make a decision sometime tonight. He's a very, very fine man. As far as Puerto Rico is concerned, that's been going, as you know, really well.
It's been total devastation. We have over 10,000 people in Puerto Rico right now. We're getting truck drivers because the people from Puerto Rico -- the drivers just aren't there. They're looking for their homes. They have a lot of other problems. Likewise with the police force.
But I think it's going really well, considering. Rick Scott was just up -- the governor of Florida -- that's been a success. Rick is going to get involved, also, with Puerto Rico. And we've made tremendous strides. Very, very tough situation.
And a big question is, what happens? We have to rebuild -- I mean, if you look at it, the electric is gone, the roads are gone, the telecommunications is gone. It's all gone. And the real question is, what's going to happen later?
It's a tough situation. The loss of life, it's always tragic. But it's been incredible the results that we've had with respect to loss of life. People can't believe how successful that has been, relatively speaking.
[Inaudible]
I can't hear you, John. Go ahead.
What do you say about the criticism of some officials in Puerto Rico -- mayor of San Juan [Inaudible]?
Well, I'll tell you, the governor of Puerto Rico has been unbelievably generous with his statements. I mean, he's been praising our efforts. And this is a very difficult -- this is a total devastation.
When you look at Texas and when you look at Florida, it's a whole different level. Nobody has ever seen when you have a Category 5 wipe out an island like this. Because you have nothing -- you don't have the roads; you don't have anything. And you don't have the people even to operate the equipment.
That's why we have literally hundreds of truck drivers being brought into the island to operate the trucks, because those people have lost their homes so they're unable to do it. And the police have lost their homes so they're unable to do it. So it's a tough situation. John.
Was Elaine Duke wrong to say that Puerto Rico was a ""good news story""""?""
Well, I haven't heard what she said. I can tell you this: We have done an incredible job considering there's absolutely nothing to work with. And a very big question is: What are we going to do with the power plant? Because the power plant has been wiped out. It's not like, let's go back and fix it. That's what I do; I'm a good construction guy. You don't go back and fix it; there is nothing. The power grid is gone.
So we have a lot of big decisions, and you're talking about -- the dollars that you're talking about are really tremendous. And I'll be talking with the Democrats and we'll be talking to Congress about what we're going to do a little bit longer term.
In the meantime, we've saved a lot of lives, we've done a really good job, and now we're bringing the people for distribution.
Do you want to shut down the embassy in Cuba? [Inaudible] diplomats in Cuba?
In Cuba?
Cuba.
Well, you know the problem we've had in Cuba -- and we'll be coming out with something -- but there was a big problem in Cuba. So we'll be announcing that fairly soon -- fairly soon.
Mr. President, [Inaudible] Puerto Rico whole again?
Well, we're looking at Puerto Rico. That's a very, very big thing you're talking about. We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars right now. It's a territory, and these are great people. I know the people very well. These are great people, but there's a massive investment. You are rebuilding all of it.
At some point, as you know, there is hundreds of millions -- there's a tremendous amount of money already invested in Puerto Rico by others before the storms. And that money has been in serious trouble. So now on top of it -- a lot of other money -- so a lot of -- look, a decision has to be made. What are you going to do?
Puerto Rico was flattened, and a big decision comes as to what are we going to do. But I'm there to help, I can tell you that.
[Inaudible] internal investigation [Inaudible]. Can you brief us a little bit on how --
Well, we have great Secretaries, and we have some that actually own their own planes, as you know, and that solves that.
But we put in an order that no more planes. If you look at past administrations -- for instance, if you look at the Obama administration and you take a look at the amount of time that they spent in the air, they spent a lot of time in the air. But I felt very badly because Secretary Price is a good man, but we are looking into it, and we're looking into it very strongly.
Do you consider it a fireable offense?
Well, we'll take a look. I'll be announcing something in the pretty near future.
Mr. President, [Inaudible] tonight's decision, how will you make it on whether to fire Tom Price? How disappointed in your Cabinet members for their travel?
I have a great Cabinet. And we save hundreds of millions of dollars through negotiation. I'll give you an example. With the F-35 fighter plane -- me, myself -- I've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in negotiating. And that's one of the reasons I don't like seeing anybody even have a question about, you know, flying. I just don't want to do that.
We've saving tremendous amounts of money no matter where we go. If you look at what we've done in Florida or Texas, we've done that for relatively little compared to what other people. So I don't like to see that happen. And I think it's a shame, because as a human being, Tom Price is very good man -- I can tell you.  John.
[Inaudible] $52,000 in a plane cost --
Well, that's unacceptable to me.
[Inaudible]
No, that's -- no, that would be unacceptable. Steve, go ahead.
[Inaudible]
I've had four meetings for Fed Chairman and I'll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks.
Where are you in the search for your new Homeland Security Secretary?
We are -- well, first of all, we've -- you know, Brock has done a fantastic job at FEMA, and Elaine Duke is acting and she's working very hard. And I think what FEMA has done has been incredible between all of these hurricanes and doing so well. But we'll be making that decision probably within a month.
Homeland?
Homeland Security, yes.
You said you spoke to Jerry Jones, the owner of the Cowboys, among [Inaudible] the whole kneeling thing. [Inaudible]
Well, I've spoken to other owners and I really think it's coming together. I noticed last night, or I was told -- I didn't see it -- but I heard everybody stood for the national anthem. And that shows respect for our country, our flag, and for the national anthem. So, you know, I'm very happy. I heard that, and they should stand. You have to stand. It's our national anthem. You have to stand.
What team owners did you talk to, though?
I spoke to numerous team owners. I have many friends. I did speak to Jerry, yes. Okay. Thank you.
Have you lost confidence in Secretary Price?
I was disappointed because I didn't like it cosmetically or otherwise. I was disappointed. And, you know, this is an administration that saves hundreds of millions of dollars on renegotiating things, on new trade deals that you'll be seeing the results very soon. We're renegotiating NAFTA. We're renegotiating so many different things and making much better deals. You'll be seeing other things come up.
So I don't like to see somebody that perhaps there's the perception that it wasn't right.
[Inaudible] be leaving your Cabinet, sir?
Well, I don't want to say, but we'll be announcing something today.
Will you accept his resignation [Inaudible]?
We'll be announcing something today.
[Inaudible]
I'm not aware of that. Yeah, I mean, I heard it was very ministerial, but I'm not aware of it. Anything else? John? Go ahead, Steve. He always treats me so nicely.
[Inaudible] something to do with Tom Price today? Or what's --
Probably today something will happen. Something will be announced.
[Inaudible]
Look, I think he's a very fine person. I certainly don't like the optics. As I said, we renegotiate deals. We're renegotiating trade deals. We're renegotiating -- as an example, the F-35 fighter plane, I've saved hundreds of millions of dollars. So I don't like the optics of what you just saw.
[Inaudible]
Cuba -- some very bad things happened in Cuba. Very bad things.
[Inaudible]
Well, you're going to see what's happening in Cuba. But some bad -- they did some bad things in Cuba.
Will you make a decision about whether or not to fire Price today?
Probably sometime today.
Do you feel pressured to do something?
I'm not happy, okay? I can tell you, I'm not happy."
2017-09-29,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-september-29-2017,"My fellow Americans. All American hearts are united with the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, who have faced terrible devastation in the wake of two catastrophic hurricanes.
We are working night and day and cooperation with territorial and local authorities to assist those in need, to help save and sustain lives, and to begin the long recovery and rebuilding effort.
Our commitment to those affected is this: we are with you, we will stay with you and we will come back stronger than ever. We are sending tremendous amounts of supplies, tremendous amounts of food and water, and we are sending great people to help.
I know that it's been devastating, I know your police force and everything else has been absolutely hurt, but we're sending people to help, and it's getting better on a daily basis.
This week I travel to Indiana to announce historic tax reform for the American people. It is based on four key ideas. First, we will cut taxes on all working American families. People will pay a lot less money. Single individuals will not be taxed on the first $12,000 of income earned and a married couple will pay zero taxes on their first $24,000 of income.
After that, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates: 12, 25 and 35. It used to be seven. We will also expand the child tax credit, eliminate the credits marriage penalty and provide a new $500 tax credit for elder care and other adult dependents.
This is the real and lasting tax relief that everyday Americans badly need and truly deserve. This is what working Americans have been after.
Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand. Under our plan, the vast majority of families will be able to file their tax on a single sheet of paper. As part of the simplification, we are also getting rid of taxes that threatened to put family businesses and American farmers out of business.
Julie Ellingson is a fourth-generation cattle rancher in Bismarck, North Dakota. Julie and her family's legacy of hard work should not be taken away when she dies. We will eliminate the death tax and keep her American dream alive. Most importantly, her family will long remember, and they'll be working hard for many many years on their farm.
Third, we are going to restore America's competitive edge, so that American businesses and workers can win again. We will cut the corporate rate below the average of our foreign competitors, and we will reduce the top marginal income tax rate on small and mid-sized businesses to the lowest in more than 80 years.
It's so important because our companies are leaving our shores, and when they leave, they let go of the workers and then they make their product and they send it back into our country. We don't tax them. We don't do anything. Those days are over.
We now have a competitive tax where our companies won't be leaving. Believe me, it won't be happening like it has. It's going to be a big difference.
Finally, our framework encourages corporations to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas, and stops punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. That's actually what's happening. Companies that stay in our country are being punished by our tax code. This will switch our current offshoring model, a tax system that drives jobs to other countries, to a new American model. Under this plan, we want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns.
This is a once in a generation opportunity to pass tax reform and to restore our jobs, our wealth, and our great American dreams. We will be able to dream again and those dreams will be met.
Now, it's time finally, for Congress to deliver. The problem we have is the Democrats don't want to cut your taxes. They want to actually raise your taxes and raise them very substantially. We can't afford to do that as a country. That's why our jobs are leaving. That's why you don't have enough left in your paycheck. We want to cut taxes, and it's going to be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-09-27,Speech: Donald Trump Discusses Tax Reform in Indianapolis,"Indianapolis, IN, United States","[-86.158068, 39.768403]",donald-trump-speech-tax-reform-indianapolis-september-27-2017,"Thank you very much. You just want massive tax cuts. That's what you want. That's the only reason you're going so wild. [Applause] But it's wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana. What a place. [Applause]
I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. [Applause]
I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well. We appreciate it. [Applause]
Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane. I mean, their island was virtually destroyed. Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.
Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly.
I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms. We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done. It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico. [Applause]
And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis. It's something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that.
And I'm very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected. And many of their policemen -- in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it's been a tough go. But we are -- we're going to get it back.
Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county's history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare. We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy. But with the rules of reconciliation, we're up against a deadline of Friday -- two days.
That's just two days. And yes-vote senator -- we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator -- who is a yes vote, but he's home recovering from a pretty tough situation. And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent.
It's going to be better managed for the people that it serves. Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C. Not even a contest. [Applause]
And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly. But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote. So we're getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.
And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I'd come in and sign. But it didn't work that way. There were a couple of people that -- I won't say anything. [Laughter] But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we're going to have a vote. And we're going to be able to get that through, and I think we'll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier.
But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve. By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won't for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one. And most of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
We're here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People. [Applause]
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it's probably something I can say that I'm very good at. I've been waiting for this for a long time. We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country -- and most people thought left our country for good. [Applause]
We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American. [Applause] It's time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers. [Applause]
Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens. This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation -- and are we cutting regulation? [Applause]
And businesses all across the country have taken notice. In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states. Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed -- meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.
All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again. They chose, and their choice was so important. It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of -- [Laughter] -- who signed the largest income tax cut in the state's history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence. [Applause]
It's time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana. We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them. That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office. That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.
Already, we're seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first. [Applause] Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It's really a fantastic thing to see. [Applause]
Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs. GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time. [Applause] And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact. But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.
Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country. [Applause]
America is back on the right track. And I see so many red hats -- Make America Great Again. That's what we're doing -- Make America Great Again. [Applause] But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code. It's a relic. We've got to change it. We have to compete -- compete with other countries.
The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America's economic comeback because it can be far greater than it's ever been. But we're going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally -- and want and deserve.
For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform. Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families -- for the working man and woman -- and for businesses of all sizes. I look forward -- [Applause] Thank you.
I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people. These tax cuts are significant. There's never been tax cuts like what we're talking about.
Our framework is based on four key ideas: First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans -- the people that work so long, so hard, and they've been forgotten. But they're not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th. [Applause]
Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free, -- [Applause] -- and a married couple won't pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income. So, a married couple -- up to $24,000 -- can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do. So much better.
In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero. [Applause] At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.
Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today. Where are they? Oh, hello, Jonathan. How are you? [Applause]
Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company. Together they're raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000. Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more. And that's just on federal taxes. So they would have saved at least $1,000.
Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for. [Applause] We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families. Greatly expanded.
We're also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children. [Applause] And this is just one more critical way that we're targeting relief to working families.
In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved -- and we love these people, but we're caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents -- will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit. [Applause]
We're doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family. By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners. [Applause]
Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected. They can call me all they want. It's not going to help. I'm doing the right thing, and it's not good for me. Believe me. [Applause]
But what is good for me -- not only as President and legacy -- what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years. That's good for me. That's good for everyone. [Applause] And that's what I think is going to happen. [Applause] And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me.
In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. We've also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.
Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally. [Applause]
Americans waste money. Americans waste so much money -- billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code. More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper. [Applause]
We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. About time. [Applause]
The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts. You're all familiar with it. Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with. We are making our taxes simple again. We are simplifying our tax system.
To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax. [Applause]
That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you'll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won't have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax -- lose the business, ends up going out of business. All of those jobs are lost. The farmers in particular are affected.
They have wonderful farms, but they can't pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. The people that buy it don't run it with love. They can't run it the same way, and it goes out. So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers. And we're getting rid of it. [Applause]
Now if you don't like your family, it won't matter, okay? [Laughter] But for those that love your family, it matters a lot. [Laughter]
With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg -- Where's Kip? Go ahead, Kip. Hi, Kip -- [Applause] -- who fears that his family's farming heritage -- it's been a long time. How long, Kip? A hundred and eighty-seven years -- that's peanuts, Kip. [Applause]
Wow. That's a long time. But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family. We're not going to let that happen.
We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today. [Applause]
We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans. Okay? [Applause]
Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. [Applause]
In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers. Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations. And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways. They say they're friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals. [Applause]
And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines -- Dakota Access. You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved. So we're letting that happen.
But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more. And it was a beautiful sight to behold.
Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did. And I shouldn't say even better because we didn't run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out. And we're stopping that, and you see it right here what we've done.
Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world. That's not good. We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we're not surrendering anymore. We're not surrendering anymore.
Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again. [Applause] We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent. That's way down from 35 and 39 -- [Applause] -- which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations.
This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven't seen in many years. [Applause]
When our companies move to other countries, it's our loyal American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it's our wonderful workers who reap the rewards.
And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they're going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States -- between increasing and new -- five. [Applause] You'll be hearing about that very soon.
And I said thank you very much, and he said, ""you know what? It's starting to happen in the United States. It's starting to happen."""" So I just wanted to let you know that. I promised I wouldn't say who. I'll keep my word. Okay? [Laughter] Unless you force me. [Laughter
Members of both parties -- it happens to be in the automobile industry. That's a good industry. [Laughter] Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country. [Applause]
And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent -- much lower. Big difference. [Applause] This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years. [Applause]
To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off -- listen to this -- the cost of equipment in the year they buy it. That is big. [Applause]
And that's instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time. Now that's called incentive. That's called incentive. [Applause] This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong.
Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis. John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations, John. [Applause]
And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I'm just thinking -- I have to mention this -- you know, we have a fence around the White House. [Laughter] We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence. And I figured, you know -- I'm pretty good at construction -- I figured, I don't know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half. And this has been taking place over a long period of time -- previous administrations.
So I said, ""how much is the fence you're talking around the White House?"""" """"Sir
We're going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million. Now, I assume it's a strong fence. [Laughter] Okay? So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million? I think he could take $49 off right now and he'd have plenty of profit. Right? Right, John? It's crazy. [Applause] It's crazy. Never understand it, but we're working on it.
John says that a tax cut like we're proposing will make his business more competitive, allowing him to expand, hire more workers, and raise wages for his current employees. Right, John?
Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology. Where's Aaron? Hello, Aaron. Hi. [Applause] It's a good field.
Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high -- and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas. You've been watching it, Aaron. Right? All over. Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States.
We're going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America. You're going to be in a much different position. Okay? [Applause] Thank you. Tremendous incentives.
We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Right? [Applause] Made in the USA.
Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. Our current tax system -- [Applause] -- trillions. And by the way, for years I've been hearing it's 2.5 trillion. So I've been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it's much more. Right? But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it.
For years -- who doesn't want to do it? They want to bring -- but they can't do it because it's so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous. So they can't do it. So the money stays in other countries, and it's invested in other countries. We want to bring it back.
But think of it, it's one of the few things -- Democrats want it and Republicans want it. So they both want it, and yet for years they haven't been able to do it. Now we're doing it. We're doing things. [Applause]
You know, it's one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there's a dispute. But here's something everybody wants and they can't do it. So you can tell you, there's a broken system in D.C., but we're getting it fixed rather -- I think -- rather rapidly. You'll be seeing that over the next few months.
Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country. We're punishing them for bringing the money back in.
As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether. And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas -- so much, it's an incredible amount -- that they move the company to get their money. We're going to let them bring the money back home. [Applause]
Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We're punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States. We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work. [Applause]
The framework I've just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America's competitive edge. Finally. [Applause]
And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews. And if Senator Donnelly doesn't approve it, because you know he's on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe. [Applause]
I think they're going to approve it. I think we'll have -- actually, I think we'll have numerous Democrats come across because it's the right thing to do.
These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates. It's what we can't do. Our competitors have much lower tax rates. But no longer. My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model. It's called -- the American model. [Applause]
Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. That's what we want. We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana. Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they're incentivized to leave. But now they're going to be incentivized to stay. And if that doesn't work, then we'll get even tougher than that. Okay?
We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. [Applause] That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family. We want it to happen here. [Applause]
Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today. I really believe we're going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it's the right thing to do.
I believe that it's the right thing to do, and I know many of them. And they're telling me it is the right thing to do. President Reagan's tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker -- Tip O'Neill.
Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment. As President Kennedy very wisely said, ""The single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time"""" -- at the right time
My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle -- it's called a middle-class miracle, once again. It's also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person.
I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country. [Applause] But they'll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard. Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first. And that's what we're doing. [Applause]
History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people. That is why today I am asking all Americans -- Republican, Democrat, independent -- to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again. [Applause]
Call your congressmen. Call your senators. Let them know you're watching. Let them know you're waiting. Tell them that today is the day for decision. That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound. And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us.
If you demand it, the politicians will listen. They will answer, and they will act. And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride. [Applause]
With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. [Applause]"
2017-09-22,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Huntsville, Alabama","Huntsville, AL, United States","[-86.5861037, 34.7303688]",donald-trump-speech-luther-strange-rally-huntsville-alabama-september-22-2017,"Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you everybody. I love this place. You know, we set every record in Alabama. I love Alabama.
It's special, thank you very much. [Audience Chants USA] Well, I am, I'm thrilled to be here with a really great person that I've gotten to know, Luther Strange, and with the hardworking, patriotic citizens of this great state. You have some football games tomorrow, but we're going to have a lot of fun and then you're going to win at football tomorrow. [Applause] I love this state and I love the people of this state.
They've been so good to me. And we are producing, we are really producing. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.
And on Tuesday, we're going to send a real fighter and a real good guy from Alabama to the United States Senate on a permanent basis. [Applause] And we have another great person in our audience tonight, Richard Shelby. Where is Richard? Where is he? Richard? [Applause] Where's Richard? Thank you, Richard. Stand up so they can see you, Richard.
Fantastic. Thank you, Richard. [Applause] Respected man, I will tell you. He's respected and loved in the Senate.
He's only been there for, what, 34 years or something like that, right? But he loves the people of Alabama, too. And like all of you, Luther Strange knows the true source of America's strength. It's God, it's family and it's country. [Applause] And Luther is going to be taking over for a man that you all love.
What's his name? Senator Jeff Sessions, you love Jeff Sessions and he's doing a good job. [Applause] He is doing a good job. We have him very busy watching the borders. A lot of things are happening.
But Luther is taking over for Jeff hopefully and you are going to be so impressed with what we're going to do in Washington. But before we begin, I want to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Texas and Louisiana and Florida and Georgia and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and all of the other communities that have recently been ravaged by storms and by floods. [Applause]
And you took such great care of those people, you really did. [Applause] I said, you know, Governor, you're the fastest-growing state anywhere in the world this week. But it was -- you really did, you did a great job. And your governor is doing a great job, too, by the way.
When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. We grieve over all that's been lost, but we're also inspired by the incredible strength and spirit and resilience of our people. Together, we will recover, rebuild and return bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It's going to happen.
It's going to happen quickly, quickly, better. Right? [Applause] We also send our prayers to the people of Mexico. They got hit hard by a devastating earthquake, taken a lot of lives, a lot more than they even thought. And I've spoken with the president of Mexico and we pledged our total support.
We have crews in there right now lifting up that heavy concrete. And it's a rough sight, it's a rough sight. We've got a lot of people we sent down with a lot of big equipment, but that's a tough go. It's a really tough thing to look at and to see and to see the sadness.
But that was bad. I've just come from a very productive week at the United Nations General Assembly. [Applause, Audience Chants USA] Where we've been working with our friends and allies to pursue a future of prosperity and security and peace. And we've got some really good people that I know and have tremendous relationships and we have some really, really bad people and we're going to take care of the bad people.
It's about time. We're going to take care of the bad people. [Applause] It's one of the greatest honors of my life to represent the American people on that world stage. And I will tell you, the world is starting to respect the United States of America again. [Applause]
As I said during my address to the United Nation, I will always defend America's interests above all else. I'm here for you, I'm not here for global interests . We're not here for the rest of the globe. [Applause] And we want to treat the rest of the globe right.
And, you know, when I say America first everyone was saying, gee, and I never liked it from the standpoint that if you're in another country you want your country to be first by the leader, right? So nobody really understood. For years they've said America first, although I'm the one that really means it, there's a big difference. [Applause] And I said, look, it's going to be America first. We're going to renegotiate these trade deals.
We're bringing a lot of people back. We're bringing companies back. You see it in Alabama. You see it in Alabama. [Applause]
But I'm not going to worry so much about other countries. I want to treat them with respect, I want to treat them good and I want their people to fight for them just like I'm going to fight. But we're going to be like your football teams, we're going to win all the time, we're going to win. Believe me. [Applause]
I believe the best path to a more peaceful world are proud, independent and sovereign nations that serve and respect their own people. When you look at what's going on in the world, you have so many where they don't respect their people. But we want nations that cooperate together to create better for all people. That's what we're all about, all people.
And we can't have madmen out there shooting rockets all over the place. [Applause] And by the way, ""Rocket Man"""" should have been handled a long time ago. [Applause] He should have been handled a long time ago by Clinton. I won't mention the Republicans
Why did this -- you know, this is a different time. This should have been handled eight years ago and four years ago and 15 years ago and 20 years ago and 25 years ago. This shouldn't be handled now. But I'm going to handle it because we have to handle it. [Applause]
Little ""Rocket Man."""" We're going to do it because we really have no choice. We really have no choice. Now
And I want to tell you something, and I'm sure he's listening because he watches every word. And I guarantee you one thing, he's watching us like he never watched anybody before, that I can tell you, that I can tell you. [Applause] And maybe something gets worked out and maybe it doesn't. Personally, I'm not sure that it will.
Other people like to say, oh, we want peace. You know, they've been saying now for 25 years, oh, we want peace, we want peace. And then he goes and just keeps going, going, going. Well, maybe something gets worked out and maybe it doesn't.
But I can tell you one thing, you are protected, OK? You are protected. Nobody is going to mess with our people. [Applause] Nobody is going to play games. Nobody is going to put our people in that kind of danger.
Nobody. [Applause] And Japan and South Korea are right up there with us. And by the way, many other countries, many, many other countries, they're right up there with us. And I have to tell you, I made a friend in China, President Xi, and yesterday he basically took the banking industry away from North Korea.
Never been done before. [Applause] Never been done. That's based on relationship. Relationship is very good.
But we're dealing with somebody that we'll figure out he may be smart, he may be strategic and he may be totally crazy. But you know what? No matter what he is, we're going to handle it, folks, believe me. We're going to handle it. [Applause] The foundation for progress begins at home with a government that protects and defends our citizens.
And that's what we have to do. That is why I'm here tonight to ask the good people of Alabama to send Luther Strange to the United States Senate so he can defend your interests, fight for your values and always put America first. Go out and get out the vote! [Applause]
But I'm going to tell you, I'll just tell you this quick, crazy story. So why do I like Luther? Because, you know, I have a lot of friends and some of them called, do you mind if I go for the other candidate? I said really you can, I mean, some of them are working for me and they feel and that's fine.
Of course, they may not have a job on Monday, but these are my -- right, Richard? We may have to get rid of a few of them. I've already gotten rid of a few of them. But they're good people. No, they're good people.
But I'll tell you what happened. The first go around on health care, I said, you know, for seven years we've been hearing repeal and replace Obamacare, right? For seven years I've been hearing repeal and replace. So I'm very much involved. You know, they like to say, well, Mr.
Trump, President Trump sat in the Oval Office and didn't -- I'm on the phone screaming at people all day long for weeks. They gave me a list of 10 people that were absolute noes. These are 10 Republican senators. Now, John McCain's list... [Booing]
John McCain was not on the list, so that was a totally unexpected thing, terrible. Honestly terrible. Repeal and replace because John McCain, if you look at his campaign, his last campaign, was all about repeal and replace, repeal and replace. So he decided to do something different and that's fine.
And I say we still have a chance to -- oh, we're going to do it eventually, we're going to do it eventually. With Luther and everyone we're going to do it. But I have to tell you this story because we're here tonight for Luther Strange. I'm here sort of for two.
I'm here for Luther and I'm actually here, it's a Friday night, I really do love the people of Alabama because you've treated me so good. [Applause] In fact, I said, I don't want to speak negatively, I said, though, that if I lose this election, maybe I'll end up moving to Alabama or Kentucky or, like, some states. [Applause] I mean, nice to go where people love you and where you love them because it's special. So here's what happened.
Here's what happened. But we never want to lose, right, despite that. We don't want to lose because we have a great agenda. And by the way, we're doing a lot of work, we're getting a lot of things done.
They hate to admit it. Including we have a Supreme Court justice, Judge Gorsuch, who will save how about a thing called your Second Amendment, right. OK, remember that? [Applause] If crooked Hillary got elected, you would not have a Second Amendment, believe me. You'd be handing in your rifles.
You'd be saying here, here, here they are. [Booing] You'd be turning over your rifles. You've got to speak to Jeff Sessions about that. [Applause] So here's what happened with Luther.
So Luther, I get this list, 10 names of people that are absolute total noes. And there were good people, a lot of them. By the way, in all fairness, Rand Paul was on that list. They said don't even waste your time calling him.
He voted twice yes, OK? He was very good. And I haven't given up on him because I think he may come around, OK? Wouldn't it be ironic if he took John McCain's place and they definitely do not like each other. Wouldn't that be ironic? That would be very ironic for those of you that know the inner workings of the Senate. So with Luther, so I have a list and one of the names is Luther Strange.
And I know he's the senator from Alabama, but I don't know him, I met him once. I said that is the tallest human being I've ever seen. I'm tall. I'm tall.
I never saw something -- he's, like, he should be on the New York Nicks, they could use him. So that's why I call him ""Big Luther
OK. And I'll get a vote or I won't, whatever, but brutal, brutal. You know what that is, folks, right? It's called brutality. I call another one, I say, Senator, we need your vote, I know you're opposed to it, but I -- well, you know, I think I can get there, but you have to do me a favor.
You have to see my brother and his wife, they love you and they want to have dinner with you and they want to have breakfast with you and lunch, then after you're finished with them, how about we'll go out for a picnic someplace on the White House lawn and then after that maybe we'll start talking about it.
I say, oh, my, oh, it was brutal. You have no idea. OK. Now I call Luther Strange.
I say, oh, I've got to call this guy and he's a no, right? And I say, Senator, I need your help. I said I've got to get your vote on health care. He says you've got it. [Applause] I said, what do you mean I have it? Because I've just been hammered by all of these people.
Right? What do you mean I have it? He said, sir, I was for you right from the beginning, I knew you were going to win, I knew you were going to win the whole thing. I've always been for you, my family has always been for you. And honestly, Mr. President, if you want my vote you have it.
I said, do I have to come and meet you someplace? Do I have to have dinner with your family? I think his wife, by the way, is fantastic. But I said, do I have to have dinner with you and your wife? No, sir, you don't have to have anything. I've supported you from the beginning and you shouldn't even waste anymore time talking to me. Mr.
President, you have my total support. I went home and told my wife that's the coolest thing that's happened to me in six months. OK? It's true. It's a true story. [Applause]
And then time goes by. And he voted and then, of course, you know, John McCain came in and he went thumbs down at 3:00 in the morning. [Booing] Oh, do I know so much, folks, I could tell you. It was sad.
And we had a couple of other senators, but, you know, at least we knew where we stood there. That was, like, really a horrible thing. Honestly, that was a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the Republican Party. That was a horrible thing.
So anyway, so time goes by and I see Luther's in a race. And people are saying he's friendly. Whether you like Mitch McConnell or not, doesn't matter, but they're saying he's friendly with Mitch. He doesn't even know Mitch McConnell.
He was just there for a few months. And they've put that mantle around his neck. And I told Mitch I'd like to say this. You know, I don't like to, but I'm telling you he doesn't know Mitch McConnell at all.
Luther is a tough, tough cookie. He doesn't deal with and kowtow to anybody. So they put it around. So all of a sudden, I see he's down in the race by a lot.
And I said, man, that's really unfair. They were giving him a bum rap because he happened to be in the Senate. They were giving him a bum rap. And I remember the call.
And by the way, the other people that I called, and they're all fine, but you don't even remember. The dinners, you don't even remember any of it. You remember one sentence: Sir, don't even waste your time talking anymore, you have a lot of business to do, you have my vote. This was a definite no.
And I said that's the coolest thing and I remembered it. And I called him. And I checked and he was down because of being saddled with stuff. He was down by quite a bit.
And I said I'm going to endorse you. And he didn't believe it. He said you would do that? I said, yeah, I'm going to do that. I shouldn't be doing it.
The last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary, OK? I could be sitting home right now getting to watch some of the games tomorrow, getting ready, right? But seriously, the last thing I wanted to do is get -- but I'll never forget the way he did that. It was really cool. So what happened is I called him and I said, you know, I want to -- first of all, how are you doing, how are you doing?
And he said, honestly I'm down a little bit, but I think we're going to -- I said I think you're going to come back, too, Luther. I think you're going to come back and you're going to kick everyone's ass and you're going to do great, you're going to do great. [Applause]
Because he got saddled with things that he should not have gotten saddled with. So he started off here, he was in third or fourth, he went to third, second and now it's, like, almost pretty even, right? And I called him up a week ago and I said, you know, I think you're down by a few points, but I'm going to come to Alabama and I'm going to make a speech for you on Friday. [Applause] And such a true story. And as soon as we announced -- you know, you look at this arena.
You know, the media, the fake news I call it, the worst, the fake news... [Booing] ...they won't show this. You know, they'll say Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd, very unenthusiastic crowd, it was a terrible evening.
No, these are among the most dishonest people. I really mean it. These are among the most dishonest. [Applause] For instance, look at the crowd.
I'd love to have them show the crowd, but they don't show the crowd, they show me the whole night. I go home, I say, Melania -- and by the way, she's become very popular, hasn't she? She's become very popular. [Applause] And, I mean, she respects the White House, we love the White House. They actually said about me that I called the White House a dump.
I think the White House is one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. And I speak of it with reverence. And they said that and they wouldn't retract it. And I hated it because I speak so well, I love the White House.
But my wife respects the White House greatly. So when she leaves the plane, we're going to Texas where they had the hurricane, and she leaves the plane and she's dressed appropriately for the White House, you know, because we respect the White House a lot. And she's wearing high heels, like many of you would do. And they went after her.
But she didn't know. And then when she got out in the plane in Texas she was wearing sneakers which she had with her. [Applause] And they know it was dishonest, but that's the way it is. They said she wore high heels.
You know, she's going to go into the floods. She's going to go into the floods with high heels. But she has become very popular. But I have to say this.
So Luther did that for me. And I remembered Luther. We have to be loyal in life, you know. There's something called loyalty with these folks. [Applause]
And I might have made a mistake and I'll be honest I might have made a mistake. Because, you know, here's a story, if Luther doesn't win, they're not going to say we picked up 25 points in a very short period of time. They're going to say Donald Trump, the president of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump.
This is total embarrassment. I mean, these are bad people. And by the way, both good men, both good men. And you know what? And I told Luther, I have to say this, if his opponent wins, I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him. [Applause]
But I have to say this, and you understand this and just look at the polls, Luther will definitely win. [Applause] You know what I'm saying. Roy has a very good chance of not winning in the general election. It's all about the general.
Don't forget, we don't stop here. You have an election coming up the day this is over. So this is over on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the new race begins.
You've got to beat a Democrat. Luther is going to win easily and Roy's going to have a hard time winning. But I will be backing him if he wins. I will be backing him, OK? I'll tell you that. [Applause]
And just like I backed Huntsville -- because, you know, if you look at Huntsville, billions and billions of dollars from the and to the Army missile defense, what you're going -- how important.
By the way, by the way, how important are those words now when you hear ""missile defense?"""" Thank you very much
Again, if the other candidate had won against me, that would have gone way down. It was going way down. You don't know what we're doing. We're rebuilding the military at a level to which it's never been before, we're rebuilding. [Applause]
But that would have gone way, way down. And then you look at, as an example, the new FBI facility that's being build. Great, great. You look at NASA, how about NASA? Billions of dollars. [Applause]
And Richard Shelby, by the way, has been a big help on this, I have to tell you, a big help. [Applause] He's been a big help. But I will say this. We're spending a tremendous amount of money in Alabama and you are doing great.
And as long as I'm president, you are going to have so much money spent here. And you know what? Lots of other states also. We're bringing back jobs. We're bringing back companies, companies are not building in other areas, in some cases they've already started the plant and they're not, they're coming back. [Applause]
I'm renegotiating NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made. It's one of the worst trade deals ever made. [Applause] We stopped other trade deals. We are doing a job.
We are -- I'll tell you what, we have jobs and companies pouring back into this country like they haven't seen, the lowest unemployment in almost 17 years. [Applause] The most number of jobs. The most number of jobs in the history of our country. Now, with all of that being said, we have a lot of people that want to work, we have a lot of people that have given up on finding jobs.
Those people are going to be taken care of. That's one of the reasons that we, we as a group, that's why we won. One of the reasons. I think we won because of the military.
I think we won because of the vets. I think we won because of the evangelicals. I mean, take a look at that, right? [Applause] But I had to tell that story about Luther because, you know what, you go back and tell it, I thought it was really cool. So I said I'll be there.
And then I saw some things that I didn't like. He was down a little further than I liked. I said I'm not sure. And I said, Luther, you have got what it takes.
You have really got it and let's go. And that was two months ago. And you've got yourself an even race. If you guys go out and vote, if he gets out the vote, you're going to win.
You're going to have a great senator. [Applause] You're going to have a great senator. And he won't only be great, he'll be the tallest senator in the history of the United States Senate. It's OK, that's not so bad, right? [Applause] And Shelby's pretty tall, too, by the way.
But he is going to be great because he's tough on crime, he's tough on borders. [Applause] Don't worry, don't even think about it. And you know who I have here tonight? General John Kelly who headed up homeland security. [Applause] And what a job he did on the borders.
Where's General? Where is he? Where is he? General, come up here quick. Come here. Come here. Four-star, come here, come, come, come, come, come. [Applause]
This guy, what a great man this is. No games, you know? You know the expression? There's no games being played. Four-star Marine, there are very few, four-star general. [Applause, Kelly greets crowd] He just wants to work.
He's done a great job. Four-star Marine, that's good. But what he did on the borders, and this is without the wall -- by the way, the wall is happening, folks, OK. Believe me, the wall is happening. [Applause]
In fact, you probably saw, you know, we have a wall up there now and we're renovating it already, it's being made pristine, perfect, just as good as new, although we may go a little bit higher than that, but that's OK. And we're building samples of the new wall. You know, it has to be a see-through wall. I don't know if you know this, frankly, I didn't know it until about a year ago, as much as I say.
If you can't have vision through it you don't know who's on the other side. Let's say we build a pre-cast concrete wall and now we have people on the other side. Literally, I was given an example. It's so bad, it's going to stop drugs, it's going to stop a lot of bad things because the drug epidemic in this country is out of control, we're going to stop it.
And I called the other day, I spoke to your governor. I said, how are you doing? She said, well, we have about 17 million people that just entered Alabama for shelter.
We're going to stop it. [Applause] But they would literally -- so you have a concrete wall, and that's what I do best, that's what I do, that's what I really do, although we done a good job at politics, too. In all fairness, we've only been doing it for about two years. [Applause] But I do best, I build.
So you have a concrete wall and you have Mexico, wonderful, wonderful place, Mexico, and you have over here the United States. But you can't see anything, right? So now they take drugs literally and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and it lands and it hits somebody on the head, you don't even know they're there. Believe it or not, this is the kind of stuff that happens.
So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through. We are now looking at samples. We have four samples that have already been built, General, right? They've been built. And we're looking at different samples already of see-through walls.
And I think also I have to be honest with you, a see-through wall would look better. You know, you don't have that whatever it might be. But we are looking at four different samples built by four great companies, four different concepts. They're just about completed.
I'm going to go out and look at them personally, I'm going to pick the right one. We're renovating the existing wall. And we are going to have as much wall as we need. You don't need it all the way.
You know, you have 2,000 miles, you don't need it because you have a lot of natural barriers, et cetera. Somebody said, well, what are you going to do? Are you going to build that wall in the middle of the river that nobody can go in? Are you going to build that wall on the mountain? I said you don't need the wall on the mountain, you have a mountain which is a wall. But we're going to build the wall, it's coming along great. We're soon going to have the final choices done.
And the renovations will be done, I would say, within the next six or seven months. We're spending a tremendous amount of money and we're going to have that. So I just wanted to let you know where we are. [Applause] So we're very, very happy about that, you know, because every once in a while you hear, well, you know, he doesn't really want to build the wall.
I say, excuse me? That's the great thing about Twitter, OK? [Applause] You know, when the press is dishonest, which is most of the time, and when they say, like, I don't want to build a wall, I can tweet that was a false story, boom, boom, boom. [Applause] No. You know, it's really not a question about we want to do a wall, but we really have to do a wall in order to stop the drugs in particular. And we've been dealing with ICE, we've been dealing with the Border Patrol.
They both endorsed me, first time they've ever endorsed a candidate for president. And these guys know better than anybody. They know better than the architects, better than the consultants. [Applause] This country used to go out and get consultants.
They'd spend a fortune on consultants to say what to do, how to build it and everything. They didn't have a clue. They got out of the Harvard school of something and they'd write about a wall. Let me just tell you, the best guys to tell you what to do are the Border Patrol or ICE.
These are the guys that know. And you know what it costs? It costs nothing, nothing. We get it free and they're happy to do it. I was with them two weeks ago.
They're happy to do it. So it's really great and it's just going to be a very important element to making America great again, like your hat. [Applause] When it comes to reforming Washington and taking on the bureaucracy, I'm telling you, because I've seen him, he's tough as hell, Luther is your man. Luther wants to end business as usual, stop the insider dealing and Luther Strange is determined to drain that swamp. [Applause]
Luther's been fighting hard for the people of Alabama and for the people of the United States since his first job in office. Now, I have to tell you something, he hasn't been there very long. And again, he doesn't know those people. He had never met them, he doesn't know them, and they can't saddle him with it, but he doesn't know those people.
But Luther has worked so hard. And I know the ones that work hard and I know the ones that don't work hard. In fact, I was talking about it with Richard before. Don't worry, Richard, I'm not going to give away any of these secrets.
But we were talking about it. We were talking about -- he's a hard worker, Richard, I want to tell you that. He's been working hard for 34 years. [Applause] But we were talking, we were talking about who are the smart ones, who are the hardworking ones.
We talked about who are the less- smart ones, too. I learned a lot. That's a lot of knowledge. But Luther shares our convictions and our vision.
And maybe most importantly, he shares our agenda. Remember, he's going to win the race. He's going to win the race. [Applause] And I'm not talking here, I'm talking against the Democrat, which starts very quickly.
But it's why we need each and every one of you to get a friend, go out, get a family member, get the whole family and bring them out to vote for ""Big Luther"""" Strange. You've got to vote for him
Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired, he's fired. [Applause, Audience Chants USA] You know, some owner is going to do that.
He's going to say that guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired. [Applause] And that owner, they don't know it, they don't know it, they're friends of mine, many of them, they don't know it, they'll be the most popular person for a week, they'll be the most popular person in this country because that's a total disrespect of our heritage, that's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for, OK? Everything that we stand for.
And I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice and many, many different freedoms. But you know what? It's still totally disrespectful. And, you know, when the NFL ratings are down massively, massively... [Applause] The NFL ratings are down massively.
Now, the number-one reason happens to be that they like watching what's happening on, you know, with yours truly. [Applause] They like what's happening. Because, you know, today if you hit too hard, right, they hit too hard, 15 yards, throw him out of the game. They had that last week.
I watched for a couple of minutes and two guys just really a beautiful tackle, boom, 15 yards. The referee gets on television, his wife it sitting at home, she's so proud of him, they're ruining the game. Right? [Applause] They're ruining the game. Hey, look, that's what they want to do, they want to hit, OK? They want to hit.
But it is hurting the game. But you know what's hurting the game more than that? When people like yourselves turn on television and you see those people taking the knee when they're playing our great ""National Anthem."""" [Booing] The only thing you could do better is if you see it
Not the same game anymore anyway. Now, one of the things we've done, and when I say ""we"""" it's us
Right? We cherish our magnificent Constitution and we believe judges must interpret the Constitution as written and that includes defending, as I just said, our great Second Amendment. [Applause] We support the rule of law and we stand strong with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] We protect our citizens, uphold our traditions and we will always defend our borders. [Applause] These are Alabama values.
I understand the people of Alabama. I feel like I'm from Alabama, frankly. [Applause] Isn't it a little weird when a guy who lives on 5th Avenue in the most beautiful apartment you've ever seen comes to Alabama and Alabama loves that guy. I mean, it's crazy, it's crazy. [Applause]
It's crazy. But I do, I understand your values, I love your values and those are the values that I believe in. Those are the values, those are the values that made this country. Those are the values that made this country great.
Those are the values. I understand those values. [Applause] But as you know, these values have been under attack for many years in Washington. And that's why we need a person like Luther Strange.
We need him. You've got to get out and vote. [Applause] You know, I think if everybody in this room gets out and votes, Luther, you win easily. You've got to vote.
Just get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. [Applause] So Luther's not in Washington to serve the special interests, like a lot of people. Even the way he handled that thing with me.
He didn't ask me, oh, you've got to do this and that. In the end, what did he do? He got better. I would never have done that. Let's say he was difficult.
I would never, but he never went quid pro quo, he just treated me great. And I called him, I said, you want me to help you? He couldn't believe it. He said, why? I said because you gave me the coolest answer I've had in a long time. That's why I'm here, he didn't ask me. [Applause]
The only mistake he made, I shouldn't say this, he said, sir, we have a venue that holds a thousand people. I said, Luther, that's no good, a thousand people, we can do much better than that. And then we came up with this job and we are packed. And by the way, outside there are thousands of people that can't get in, they do not have your real estate ability.
OK? Thousands, you've got thousands of people outside. [Applause] Thousands. And they may be listening because we put some big speakers out there and I hope they're going to vote for Luther. They may not be too happy.
But I think they will. So Luther came to Washington to serve you and to represent you. And I can tell you that when ""Big Luther
We don't have to go into it because a lot of them are now friends of mine, a lot of them are friends of mine. So nobody ever called you ""Big Luther?"""" I think it's a great name. The guy is 7 feet tall. What are you going to do? Call him -- I can never call him little Luther
But when he walks in, everybody knows that Alabama has arrived. [Applause] Luther was a very, very advanced Eagle Scout who has not spent his lifetime in politics. He only entered public life in recent years. And he's been in Washington for even less time than me, so he doesn't know all these people that he's supposed to know.
He has his own mind. He has the mind that you want. In his short time in public office, Luther has proved that he's not beholden to anyone and not afraid to take on anyone. And I've seen it.
As your attorney general in Alabama, Luther won over 25 public corruption convictions. [Applause] And now he's brought that same political courage to Washington. And I have to tell you, friends of mine, because I have a lot of friends in Alabama.
And friends of mine have told me very strongly that if Luther wasn't appointed to office for the short term, if he just said he's going to run when you have to run, which is now, he'd be leading every poll by 50 points, he'd be killing everybody. But the fact that he got appointed hurt him.
In fact, he was thinking about not accepting that. But if Luther just didn't take an appointment, if he just ran, there wouldn't even be a contest. Nobody could come close to him. So it's one of those things.
But I can tell you personally, because I've been dealing with him for the months that he's been there, I'm very lucky and this country is very lucky that he did take that appointment because he's done a hell of a job. [Applause] And that's what we need in Washington, people who have the courage to stand strong for our values, our family, our nation, people who have the courage to challenge a failed system.
Look with Obamacare, I've been listening for seven years as many of these people -- now, Richard kept voting against it, but many of these kept saying repeal and replace, repeal and replace. Then they finally have now -- they didn't care, nobody cared because they had a president that wasn't going to sign it and they didn't have the Senate, so it didn't matter.
So it didn't take much courage. So they were getting all these great votes, you know, like, I think they voted, what, 61 times, like, 61 times to repeal and replace. They finally get a president who will sign the legislation and they don't have the guts to vote for it. OK? They don't have the guts to vote for it. [Booing]
And I was told congratulations, you won, you won. You know why I won? Because the Electoral College is a very special thing. And I decided, very, I think, intelligently, to campaign in the states that you have to win for the Electoral College victory that you need. You know, it's very simple, very simple. [Applause]
I took a pass on a lot of states, the Electoral College, and I've never really been in favor of it, but now I appreciate it. No, no, I tell you what. To me, winning the popular vote is easier because you go to New York, you go to California, you go to Texas. The beauty with the Electoral College is I was going to Maine, I was going all over.
I was going to smaller states It brings the whole country into play. It brings certain states into play that would never really be thought of. [Applause] But I focused heavily on Pennsylvania and North Carolina. I focused very heavily here.
But I actually made one speech here. And I said, fellow and folks, do you mind if I don't come back for a while because we have, like, a 38-point lead and I'd much rather spend my time in Florida, which we won quite easily, and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and lots of other places. [Applause] So, Alabama, you were great. I mean, we won by so much.
So the Electoral College is actually something I've come to respect. But it's sort of, like, if you're a 100-yard dash guy or if you're a long- distance runner, you train differently. Well, if you're going for the Electoral College, that's a much different race. So if Hillary runs again in four years, which I hope she does, we're going to teach her... [Booing]
...we're going to teach her to spend more time in Michigan. We're going to teach her to go to Wisconsin. We're going to teach her to spend a little more capability in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, which she lost, and she actually spent a tremendous amount of money. So I just want to -- because, you know, you hear so much about this.
Remember this: If you're going for the Electoral College, it's a much different race. You don't spend your time in California and New York and these different places. You spend your time in Iowa and Ohio. Remember? You can't win unless you win Ohio.
Well, we won Ohio by a lot because I spent a lot of time up there. [Applause] But I would rather have the popular vote count because for me it would be easier than winning the Electoral College, which they said a Republican could not win, if you remember. Remember, they said there is no way to 270 for Trump. That's why I went to Maine four times because I needed one, I needed one.
They said there is no way. Well, we ended up with 306. There is no way. I guess they were right. [Applause]
No, no, Luther, they were right. They were 100 percent right. There is no way to 270, yes, but there is a way to 306. OK? So we won by a lot.
But when you hear all this nonsense, when you're a golfer and you have match play or you're a golfer and you have stroke play, different tournament, you train differently. Same with runners, same with lots of other things. So they have to learn their lesson. They have to campaign in areas that really matter.
But we had such a great victory it was just something that was awe-inspiring and something that I think everybody in this room will never, ever forget. And I appreciate the fact that the people of Alabama were with me right from the first day. And they said to me don't come back, go to those other states that you have to work. I appreciate it. [Applause]
And by the way, folks, just in case you're, like, curious, no, Russia did not help me. OK? Russia. [Applause] I call it the Russian hoax, one of the great hoaxes. Actually, that's the thing I was thinking about.
That's the thing that the Democrats did best. They lost the election and they didn't know what happened. And they needed an excuse, so they said Russia. And then they said, wait a minute, wait a minute, Russia and Trump.
Honestly? It's the thing they did best. They did a rotten job of running. But to convince people about this hoax, that was probably the thing that they did best, but it is one great hoax. No, Russia did not help me, that I can tell you, OK. [Applause]
Any Russians in the audience? Are there any Russians in the audience please? I don't see too many Russians. I didn't see too many Russians in Pennsylvania. I didn't see too many Russians. We need people in this country who have the courage to say what they mean, to do what they say and never, ever to back down.
As your attorney general, Luther helped you lead the fight in court against the Obama administration's big power grabs. That includes challenging the EPA's clean power plan, which, by the way, did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone. Look at that guy, he knows. Gone. [Applause]
And I did that one without Luther. But he defended it and got rid of a lot of things on a state level. And also, I've defended and Luther has defended so vigorously religious liberty from Obamacare and the fighting of Obama's and the administration's dangerous, dangerous, really almost you could say inhumane plan on refugees. It's inhumane.
When I opened my election, I talked about what was happening, the viciousness of what was happening. A lot of people thought it was tough, turned out to be true. In fact, it turned out to be understated, not overstated. And that was a big part of our success.
Since the day ""Big Luther"""" arrived in the United States Senate
I'm just telling you he doesn't know him, he just just got there. I said, how well do you know him? He said I just met him, because he just got there. He's been there for a very short period of time. And in fact, he just came out against, and he was against it before, but he just came out against that totally ridiculous rule, the filibuster rule.
It's ridiculous. [Applause] So we have 52 senators. And on a lot of legislation, you need 60 votes. That means we have to get eight Democrats.
And then they get upset with me when I go to see Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who are very nice, they get upset. Why did you see them? I said because this rule is crazy. We have 260 bills. Many of those bills, not all of them, because they can use reconciliation for those of you that are interested in that, but that's a trick, that's just a trick, many of those bills will never get passed, most of them won't because you cannot get 60 votes, you cannot.
It means that eight Democrats control the Senate. Now, I think we're going to pick up seats in '18. I'm going to work very hard. I think we're going to pick up Democratic seats, I believe that. [Applause]
We're going to pick up Democratic seats, but they have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Basically, we can't go to 60, we want 51. That's how we have Judge Gorsuch. If we didn't have that, you would not have Judge Gorsuch right now on the Supreme Court. [Applause]
Luther was with us on withdrawing the United States from the deeply unfair, job-killing Paris climate accord. OK? [Applause] You know, it sounds so nice, but it was a killer. It was a killer for our country and it was very unfair. As an example, we kick in now -- China, who I love right now, this week.
Don't forget, that was a big thing. Got a 15 to nothing vote twice. And I must say, Russia and China both came along, they both came along, that was a great thing. [Applause] And maybe more importantly, maybe it's more important, but maybe more importantly that when China did this banking thing, that's so big.
Let's see. I'll let you know if it's big in a little while. Let's see what happens, OK? Let's see what happens. But certainly, it's never been done and I think you're going to see some good things.
I think China wants to get this problem over with, they don't need it. That's their part of the world, they don't need it. They do not need this problem. And they're very smart and they're good people.
And the president is a really good man and he loves China. But it's good for China getting rid of that menace. It's really good for China, believe me. [Applause] Luther's with us on cracking down on dangerous sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens into our communities.
What's that all about? [Booing] And by the way, Jeff Sessions is working very hard on that, really hard, really hard and effectively, very effectively. [Applause] Luther is with us on cutting taxes and bringing jobs back to America. He's with us on giving our military the tools, unlimited. He wants the military taken care of and funding the fight so that we win without question and that's where we're going, $700 billion. [Applause]
He not only has my endorsement, remember this, he also has the endorsement of my great friend and vice president, Mike Pence. [Applause] He has the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the NRA. That's a biggie, that's a big one. Luther, that's big. [Applause]
He's got the endorsement of the National Right to Life and the Alabama farmers, that's big stuff. [Applause] Those a big endorsements. That NRA endorsement, I'm telling you, that is a powerful endorsement. With Luther Strange, you don't just send a message to Washington, you send a fighter to change Washington the way we all know it can be.
Since Election Day on November 8th, we've already achieved historic wins for the American people. The stock market has reached its highest point in history. [Applause] They hate it. They hate to hear that, oh.
We're up, like, 22 percent since November, 22 percent since Election Day. I think it's even more than that. But it's reached the highest point, think of it, the highest point. And unemployment is at the lowest level it's been for 16 years, close to 17. [Applause]
Most importantly to me, and I have to say it and I'll say it again because I said it at the beginning, but I have to sort of wrap it up and say it again, companies are flowing back into our country. They want to be here. [Applause]
I was with one of the great gentlemen that I became friendly with, a leader of a major, major country, so I won't tell you because I said I'd keep it private, so, you know, there are only probably a lot of people watching on television. Oh, look at all those red lights.
It's always fun to see a red light. Like, CNN has a red light on. And then I start saying it's fake news and you see that light go off so fast. [Applause] By the way, do you think they showed the room? Look, do you think they showed up the little nooks and crannies of this? Do you think they showed the room? I don't think so. [Applause]
If there's an empty seat, they'll show that empty seat. Two people, they got up, they went to the bathroom, they're coming back in five, they show those empty seats every single time. [Applause] Fake news. So I'm really proud because a record, in the history of our country, stock market, tremendous gains.
People that run companies, that truly hate me, they now love me. They're coming up, Mr. President, sir, I'm making them all, everybody -- and that means jobs, it means everybody. I'm serious.
People that truly dislike your president, the heads of these companies are coming up and hugging me and kissing me and, oh, they are just -- but I'm not doing it for them, I'm doing it for jobs, I'm doing it for the country. That I can tell you. [Applause]
Doing it for the country. I told you many times during the campaign, but I told you many times, and this is not even a choice, we're renegotiating NAFTA and we're either going to get a fair deal or we're going to terminate NAFTA.
It's very simple, OK? Because it's one of the worst deals ever, ever negotiated. [Applause] One of the worst deals ever negotiated. Every day I am keeping my promise. We have done so much.
You know, they don't like to say it, but we've passed over 50 pieces of legislation. That means going through Congress, that means getting approved by the House and the Senate and signing. That's not including all of the executive orders I've signed. That's not including the fact that we have reduced unnecessary regulations to a point that this country hasn't seen in years.
And we're not finished yet. [Applause] But one of my biggest promises has been to our great veterans. And we are doing one of our best jobs there. [Applause] We are doing one of our best jobs with our veterans.
We publish online wait times at every VA facility, opened the promised White House VA hotline, extended Veterans' Choice. Do you know what that is? The veterans, our greatest people, these are our greatest, our bravest, our most wonderful people. [Applause] And in some cases, they get older and things happen. They're waiting in line for seven days, for nine days, for 16 days.
And in some cases, they die. In some cases, they could have a simple procedure, they can have a simple prescription and it takes 11 or 12 days to get off line to see the doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. So I said, without knowing much, but having a lot of common sense and very good up here, always, always... [Applause]
But I said, you know, like you people, I said that doesn't make sense if they're waiting in line. Can you imagine, we have a lot of people that are very successful people here, can you imagine going to your doctor and having him say you'll have to wait for 11 days?
If I have to wait for two seconds I go crazy. Hopefully, we don't have to see too many doctors, that's even better, right? But they wait for days and days. And now they go, right outside, they go to a doctor in the area, we pay the bill and it's the least expensive thing we can do and we save everybody's life and everybody's happy. [Applause]
Everybody's happy. And when I first heard, because I've only been doing this for a little while, but when I first heard of the problem, that's what I said. Why aren't they just going to see a doctor we'll pay? And we've got to negotiate with the doctors pretty careful because, you know, I know a lot about doctors where they charge a lot of money, so we've got to be a little careful. But now the people are happy.
We are doing so many things. We have VA worker accountability. For 40 years they've been trying to get it passed, they couldn't. I will not blame the unions and I will not blame civil service.
But that was the problem, OK? You have the unions, you have the -- they didn't want it. For 40 years, they couldn't get it passed. So you would have people working in the VA who were sadists, who would abuse our great, great people, our great veterans. By the way, 25 years before, they would have had their ass kicked by the same person that they're abusing.
They would have been in trouble. [Applause] They would have been in trouble. Twenty-five years earlier, they wouldn't be doing it. But that's the way it is.
But they're sadists or they're doing a bad job or they're not working. You couldn't fire them. I had passed the VA Accountability Act. We have a great man, David Shulkin, Dr.
David Shulkin, he's running the VA. He has done more in eight months than they've done at the VA for years and years and years. And it's really getting good over there, so very proud of him because I made that promise. [Applause] And in the best tradition of America's greatest leaders, we're standing up for American workers and defending American jobs and American industry. [Applause]
We're building our future with American hands, American labor and American iron, aluminum and steel. We will buy American, we will hire American. In first month in office... [Applause] ...I withdrew the United States from the disastrous and job- killing, it would have been a disaster, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
A great ripoff. You want to see jobs leave the country, sign that. And they were going to sign that as fast as they could. That was a disaster for this country.
We're eliminating unnecessary regulations so we can create more jobs and wealthy right here in America. I've ended the Obama administration's war on coal and we're putting our wonderful coal miners back to work producing beautiful clean coal. [Applause]
And here's one that nobody had the guts to do and I did it in my first very few days in office. I authorized the construction of the Keystone Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, over 50,000 jobs, 50,000 beautiful construction jobs. [Applause]
And environmentally better, much better. We've increased our military and defense budget to the highest level it's been probably ever. [Applause] It's going to be over $700 billion. We're going to rebuild it.
We are rebuilding. We're ordering new fighters, we're ordering new jets. You know what's been happening. The jets are so old that the father flew them and then the son goes into the Air Force and he flies the same plane.
True. And we've committed to expanding and improving a state-of-the-art missile defense system. Thank you very much, Huntsville, Alabama. Thank you.
Thank you, Huntsville. Right? [Applause] It's amazing the way all of a sudden missile defense system sounds so good. And by the way, these systems, I watch them and I see what's being developed. I mean, they're taking out rockets that are going so fast and the percentage of success is so high, it's so brilliant what we can do so that we can do what we have to do to have a safe country.
So I want to thank you, Huntsville, because you're a big part of it. [Applause] We've just brought back the National Space Council to restore America's legacy of leadership in space, it leads to so many things. [Applause] The council will be chaired by Vice President Pence who is visiting your NASA facility in Huntsville on Monday to get you out to vote. That's why, get you out to vote. [Applause]
And we're making our communities safe again by going after violent criminals and putting dangerous offenders behind bars. They're going in fast, they're going in fast. [Applause] We have the backs of our police officers, our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers. And we have their backs 100 percent, just like they take care of us. [Applause]
One by one we're finding, and I mean in large numbers, and our guys are much tougher than their guys, we're finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people. We're throwing them the hell out of our country and we will not let them back in. They don't come back in anymore. It's a different age. [Applause]
They don't come back in. We also understand that immigration security is a national, it's really a national treasure, but it's a national security. We need national security for safety. We're going to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.
Sorry, sorry. [Applause] Call up some of the other countries in the world, say, how are you doing, folks? Not so good. We're creating an immigration system that puts American workers and American families first. We're moving quickly to pass a massive tax cut and simplification for the middle class.
We want new tax returns, we want simplification, we want reform. And you know what we really want? We want massive tax cuts. That's what we're doing for business, that's what we're doing for the middle class. [Applause] If we want to restore American prosperity, we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American. [Applause]
The United States currently has the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, 60 percent higher than other developed countries. This is a massive economic disadvantage for America costing us millions and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. Under our plan that you're going to see next week -- enjoy it, OK, enjoy it. You're going to love it... [Applause]
...it'll be the biggest tax cut. I've got to get it approved by Richard and by Luther, but I have a feeling you'll be OK. Luther, you promise? Because if you don't vote for it, I'm leaving right now. I'm going to take away -- if he doesn't vote for it, I'm taking away the endorsement.
No, but under Luther and under Richard, we're going to have one of the lowest tax rates in the developed world, bringing back our jobs, our companies, bringing them back to our shores. With Luther's help, we're going to reform our tax code to make American business competitive again so that American workers and American companies can win again. [Applause]
We're going to bring back to our country three, four, maybe five, nobody even knows what the number is, but many trillions of dollars that is currently parked overseas. And it will be invested right here in the good old USA.
It's coming back into our country. Right now it's impossible to get it back. [Applause] We're committed to protecting small businesses and family farmers by ending the death tax on estates. [Applause] You lose your farm, you lose your business, you can't pay the tax, we're getting rid of the death tax.
In addition to passing historic tax reforms, Luther and I are totally dedicated to repealing and replacing Obamacare. Now, I have to tell you, maybe we're going to do it now. It's a little tougher without McCain's vote, I'll be honest, it's a little tougher, but we've got some time. We're going to go back.
You know, it's like a boxer, they get knocked down, get up, get knocked down, get up, get knocked down, and then the bad ones they stay on the stool and they say we quit, we quit. The great ones get up and they end up winning. That's what we're going to do. [Applause] We might have to go back again and again.
I mean, like, we may make it this time. But the most we'll be is one or two votes short. You can't quit when you have one or two votes short, you can't do it. And those people are not going to be liked by the communities that they come from.
Because in most cases, in I think almost all of the cases, they got elected on the basis of repealing and replacing and they are not doing a service to the people that they represent. [Applause] Luther Strange fought against Obamacare as attorney general of Alabama and he fought it well. And he's fighting Obamacare in the Senate and he's going to keep fighting because we're going to win. It's going to be gone.
And we're going to have great health care in this country. [Applause] Your premiums are surging, your deductibles are through the roof. Alabama's way up, but we have states that are up 150 percent. We have one state, the state of Alaska, it's up more than 200 percent.
And I'm having a hard time getting a certain vote, but she's a good person and I think she's going to come through. I mean, if you look, Alaska is up over 200 percent. So that means Obamacare is no good. So we shouldn't have a hard time getting her vote and I think she's going to come through.
I hope so. Insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting, choices are disappearing. Congress must do its job by ending the Obamacare nightmare. [Applause] So to deliver for American families, we are also working to pass the RAISE Act, legislation that would end chain migration and switch our country to a merit-based immigration system, merit, merit, merit, people that will help our country, people that will help our country. [Applause]
We have Tom Cotton, we have David Perdue, two great senators, and they're working on it. The RAISE Act would keep new immigrants from going on welfare for five years. Isn't that nice? They don't walk over and say I'm going on welfare. Isn't that nice.
Maybe keep them from ever going on welfare. And would require them to support themselves and their families financially. [Applause] It's time to create an immigration system that serves the interests of the United States of America. We also want an infrastructure bill that generates $1 trillion of investment in rebuilding our country with American hands and skill and grit.
We want to lift Americans from welfare to work, from dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity. [Applause] Right? We want every American child to grow up learning the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job well done. [Applause]
We want our citizens to go to work every morning in a job they love, supporting their families and lifting up their communities, like you people have done so well. But we can only bring prosperity back to our country and hope to our struggling communities if we can take our America first agenda, if we can take our make America great again agenda back to Washington and drive it to victory.
We can only achieve those historic legislative wins, and we've had a lot of them in a short period of time, if we have patriots in Congress who are willing to stand up and fight for what we believe. And that guy can do it. [Applause] We can only win those fights and we can only drain the swamp if we have smart, tough and tenacious leaders who know who they represent and they know how to deliver. Luther Strange is our man.
He's our man. You've got to get out and vote. [Applause] I mean, again, I'm taking a big risk because if Luther doesn't make it they're going to go after me, Luther, these people, these very dishonest people. They're going to say Trump, Trump, Trump, OK? But we've done great together and we have done great over the last two months right here.
This is our moment, this is your moment. This is a big day because you have a lot of people banking on somebody else's victory and then thinking they're going to become Democrats in the state of Alabama. And I don't think that's a good thing. [Booing] That's not a good thing.
If this man wins, that race is over. If somebody else wins, I will tell you, that's going to be a very tough race. Every day, we must fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life, for a government that serves you, that protects your family, that upholds your laws and that honors your faith and that defends values and that always puts the needs of our citizens first. [Applause] We are Americans and the future belongs to us.
The future belongs to all of you. But we have got to go out and take it. We have got to go out and earn it. We have got to go out and vote.
If we don't vote, it's not going to happen. So on Tuesday, vote for your country, vote for your family, vote for your victory, vote for Luther Strange, he's a phenomenal person. [Applause]
And together with the great people of Alabama, and you're giant in the Senate, we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again! Thank you, Alabama. I love you. Thank you. I love you, Alabama."
2017-09-22,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Bedminster, NJ","Bedminster, NJ, United States","[-74.68039999999999, 40.669264]",donald-trump-weekly-address-september-22-2017,"My fellow Americans. The American Family has always been the heart of our great nation. In homes across this country, families teach their children to work hard, to love each other, and to make the most of their talents in pursuit of their dreams.
Yet for too long, American families have been hurt by Washingtonâs policies that put the interests of other countries before the interests of our country.
That is why, in my Administration, we are pursuing tax cuts and reform that create jobs in America, for American workers â not foreign workers, but American workers.
Here are my four principles for tax reform:
First, we are going to make the tax code simple and fair so that families can spend more time with their children, and less time wading through pages of paperwork. A staggering ninety-four percent of families use professional help to do their taxes â and thatâs not fair, thatâs not right. That's why under our plan, ninety-five percent of Americans will be able to file their tax return on a single page without keeping receipts, tracking paperwork, or filling out extra schedules.
Second, we are going to cut taxes for the middle class so that hardworking Americans can finally save more for their future. We want to help families keep more of what they earn â and to be able to afford the costs of raising a family. Our tax code should recognize that the most important investment we can make is in our children.
Third, we are going to restore Americaâs competitive edge by making our tax system more attractive for investment and job creation. Our business tax rate is the highest in the world â pushing jobs to foreign countries. Thatâs not what we want, thatâs not what Iâve been talking about all these years â Iâve been talking about the exact opposite. We need to bring down our tax rate so we can create jobs, wealth, and opportunity right here, in the United States of America, so we can bring our hobs back and bring our businesses back. We want tax reform that puts America First. We want tax reform that makes America great again.
Finally, we are going to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas so that it can be invested in our country, where it belongs.
We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our tax code and pave the way to unprecedented prosperity. By doing what weâre doing, we will see results like youâve never seen before. It will be the largest tax cut in our countryâs history.
I am asking members in both parties to come together, to put aside partisan differences, and to pass historic tax reform and tax cuts for the great citizens of our nation. Thatâs how we will all succeed and thrive together â as one team, one people, and one American Family. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-09-19,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the United Nations General Assembly,"New York, NY, United States","[-74.0059728, 40.7127753]",donald-trump-speech-united-nations-general-assembly-september-19-2017,"Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, world leaders and distinguished delegates, welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.
As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.
Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high, a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.
And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.
We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.
But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value.
Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.
International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders. And new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.
To put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril.
It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear.
This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars, they're pillars of peace: sovereignty, security and prosperity.
The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world.
We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
This is the beautiful vision of this institution. And this is the foundation for cooperation and success. Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.
In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example.
We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans, and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law.
The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three, beautiful words. They are ""We the people."""" Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words
In America the people govern, the people rule and the people are sovereign.
I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people where it belongs.
In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens, to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values.
As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first.
All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return.
As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interest above all else. But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure.
America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia.
It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others.
Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.
For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values.
That realism forces us to confront the question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?
If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.
We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow, and just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.
The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become bystanders to history.
The forces of destruction only gather power and strength. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more.
We were all witness to the regime's deadly abuse. When an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator's brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13 year old, Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.
If this is not twisted enough now, North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would armed supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.
No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals armed itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That's what the United Nations is all about. That's what the United Nations is for. Let's see how they do. It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-nothing votes, adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved, but we must do much more.
It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. We face this decision, not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime, one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations.
In this room, the Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogues whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos.
The longest suffering victims of Iran's leaders are, in fact its own people, rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful, Arab and Israeli neighbors
This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran's people, also goes to shore up Basha al-Assad's dictatorship, fuel Yemeni Civil War and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.
The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it. Believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.
It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained and, above all, Iran's government must stop supporting terrorists begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran won't change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprisoned political reformers.
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nation's proud roots as a center of civilization, culture and wealth, where their people can be happy and prosperous?
Once again, the Iranian regime support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its finance in Saudi Arabia. Early last year I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire world. We must deny the terrorists, safe-haven, transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology
We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East. To crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens, they use to launch attacks on all of our people.
Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interest will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.
We have made big gains toward lasting defeat of Isis. In fact, our country has achieved more against Isis in the last eight months than it has in many many years combined. We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people the actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens.
Even innocent children shock the conscience of every decent person. No society could be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries.
To be part of the rebuilding process for the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.
This is the safe responsible and humanitarian approach for decades. The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries for the sending countries.
It reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms for the receiving countries. The substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.
I want to salute the work of the United Nations and seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine, prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia and northern Nigeria and Yemen.
We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief, the president's malaria initiative, the global health security agenda, the Global Fund to end modern slavery and the woman entrepreneurs' finance initiative.
Part of our commitment to empowering women. All across the globe, we also thank. We also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity.
Too often, the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution's noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments, with egregious human rights records, sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.
Major portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that, one day soon, the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world.
In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share. The burden militarily or financially, nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.
That is why, in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embrace the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom.
My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. We have also imposed tough calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse
The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere. It has been tried to make matters worse.
Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing, their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch as a responsible, neighbor and friend.
We and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.
We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented from the Soviet Union to Cuba, to Venezuela wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted. It has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.
Those who preach the tenants of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.
All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity. In America. We seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.
For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factors disappeared, others gamed the system and broke the rules and our great middle class once the bedrock of American prosperity was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government, the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America's strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.
If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its members.
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies nations that seek allies to be friend, not enemies.
To conquer and most important of all nations that are home to patriots to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.
In remembering the great victory that led to this body's founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved patriotism led the polls to die, to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.
We cannot wait for someone else for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies. We can't do it. We must solve our problems to build our prosperity to secure our future or we will build vulnerable to decay domination and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today for people all over the world who hope for better for themselves and their children is a basic one. Are we still Patriots?
Do we love our nation's enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?
One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was affected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke when we looked around and understood that we were a nation, we realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend from its very first moments. The American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, Security and Prosperity for all. Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task.
Our answer will be a renewal of will a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and world of proud independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful earth.
This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul. So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world.
We will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity and for the Almighty God who made us all. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world and god bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."

I would like to begin by continuing to send our prayers to all of those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. From Texas to Louisiana to Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, we are coordinating closely with local authorities to help everyone impacted by these catastrophic storms.
When Americans are in need, America pulls together. And we will not rest until everyone is safe, sound, and secure. We will be there tomorrow and the day after, as we work to respond, recover, and rebuild. When Americans are united, no force on earth can break us apart.
This week, the United States celebrates the 230th Anniversary of the signing of our remarkable Constitution. The fifty-five Delegates to the Grand Convention in Philadelphia met from May to September of 1787. They gave us an incredible gift: a vision of the sovereign and self-governing people to control their own affairs. And they gave us a Constitutional system that protected our liberties by enshrining the Rule of Law.
Patriots like Washington, Madison, Hamilton, Franklin, and so many others had already achieved immortality through their victory in the Revolution. But soon after, these extraordinary leaders faced another task unlike any otherâthe task of building a brand new nation. So they designed a system of government, rooted in common laws, history, and traditions that would secure the liberty, equality, and rights they had fought for and fought to defend in the American Revolution.
The Framers of our Constitution triumphantly declared to whom the government of the United States belonged: it was ""We the People."""" These three beautiful words are among the most important ideas in our nation's history: the idea that government's power is vested in the nation's citizens â the people to whom we owe our ultimate and sacred allegiance. Our soldiers fight and die to protect our citizens
For 230 years, we have governed ourselves and planned our own destiny, guarded all the way by the Constitution of the United States. On this Sunday, Constitution Day, let us recommit ourselves to our Founding Principles, and rededicate ourselves to our glorious heritage.
We have inherited a birthright of freedom â we must defend it dearly, protect it jealously, and promote it proudly, as one nation under God. We must rise to the task of self-governance, prove worthy of the sacrifices made to carve out this magnificent nation, and we must give our loyalty to our Republic and its citizens in all that we do.
So let us pledge allegiance to our flag, devote our hearts to our country, and demonstrate our love for one anotherâas Americans, as Patriots, and as the children of God. Thank you."
2017-09-08,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-september-8-2017,"My fellow Americans. As Hurricane Irma approaches, my administration is working closely with our state and local partners to help save lives, protect families, and assist those in need. This is a storm of absolutely historic destructive potential.
I ask everyone in the storm's path to be vigilant, and to heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement. Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our people.
We are doing everything we can to help with disaster preparations, and, when the time comes, we will restore, recover, and rebuild, together as Americans. In times such as these, we see the strength and the resolve of the American spirit, and we see the kindness and courage of our people.
With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm's path, America stands united, and I mean totally united. From Texas to Louisiana. from Florida to Puerto Rico, and always the U.S. Virgin Islands and everywhere in between that has been affected by these terrible storms, we will endure and come back stronger than ever before.
Earlier this week, I visited the hard working citizens of North Dakota to promote our vision for tax cuts and tax reform that will create opportunity and prosperity for millions and millions of Americans. As president I am committed to pursuing an economic policy that lifts up all of our citizens, provides hope for all of our communities, and generates wealth for everyday hardworking people, and it's about time.
Since January, we've already created 1.2 million jobs. Unemployment is near a 16-year low. Wages are rising. But for our economy to truly take off, like it should, we must cut taxes and reform our badly broken tax system.
Our current burdensome tax code is a massive lead weight against the American economy. It costs us millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. My administration is working closely with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay and lower taxes for businesses of all sizes, and most importantly, for middle class families all across America.
First we're going to make filing taxes as simple as possible. If you're like most Americans, under our plan, you will file your taxes on a single page. What a difference that will make, and you won't need to keep endless receipts and paperwork. We are freeing you from the horrible tax maze.
Secondly, we will cut taxes for middle class families. We want you to keep more of your hard earned money. This way, you can spend it you can save it, you can do whatever you want.
Third, we will restore our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for the American worker. Today we have the highest business tax rate anywhere in the developed world. Sixty percent higher on average than our major foreign competitors.
It's a crushing tax on every product made in America, and it encourages American businesses to ship jobs and factories overseas, something that I have been fighting long and hard, and we are making tremendous headway. Believe me, they're starting to move back to our country, and the jobs are coming with them.
We are going to cut taxes on American industry, so we can create more business in our country. We want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and towns.
Finally we will make it easier for companies to bring back trillions of dollars that they are now keeping overseas. And the reason is, that taxes too high and the bureaucracy is too great. It is so complicated for them to bring back their money that they say: let's just leave it over here, we won't bring it back to the United States. Terrible situation. We're going to take care of it.
But this money should be brought back to American soil where it can be invested in new factories and brand new beautiful jobs. Our plan is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro America. This is our chance to give American workers a level playing field, to end the rigged system that lets special interests win at the expense of the middle class, and to reestablish our economic dominance for generations to come.
That is how we all succeed and grow together, as one team, one people and one American family. Frankly, that is how we make America great again. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America."
2017-09-06,Speech: Donald Trump on Tax Reform at Event in North Dakota,"Mandan, ND, United States","[-100.8895761, 46.8266603]",donald-trump-speech-tax-reform-north-dakota-september-6-2017,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you. I was just with our governor. He said, you know, Mr. President, we could have had 25 times the number of people, but for policy speeches, they like to keep them just like this.
But I appreciate -- this is tremendous. And this is truly a tremendous state. And we appreciate it very much. We appreciate you being here. Thank you. [Applause]
And the policy we're talking about is cutting your taxes. Do you like that policy? [Applause] Well, you're the hardworking people who provide the energy that makes this country run, and we are finally getting the government out of the way so you can do your jobs. Finally happening. [Applause]
Prior to leaving the White House, I had a great bipartisan meeting with Democrat and Republican leaders in Congress, and I'm committed to working with both parties to deliver for our wonderful, wonderful citizens. It's about time. We had a great meeting with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the whole Republican leadership group.
And I'll tell you what, we walked out of there -- Mitch and Paul, and everybody, Kevin -- and we walked out and everybody was happy. Not too happy -- because you can never be too happy -- but they were happy enough. And it was nice to see that happen for a change because that hasn't happened for a long time in this country -- for a very long time.
I want to take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Texas and Louisiana who have truly suffered through a catastrophic hurricane. [Applause] One of the worst hurricanes in our country's history. And guess what? We have another one coming. You see that.
But our hearts are heavy with sadness for those who have lost everything. They have also filled us with hope because you watched and you witnessed the unyielding strength and resilience of the American spirit. You looked at that in Texas. You looked at Louisiana. You saw the spirit; you saw the spirit of so many other people coming from all over.
It was a great thing. I was there twice, and I will tell you the people were absolutely incredible. What they've gone through -- you would not believe this could have happened.
And I know you have a little bit of a drought. They had the opposite. Believe me, you're better off. You are better off. They had the absolute opposite.
The compassion of our citizens and the courage of our first responders makes us all very proud to be an American. [Applause] I can tell you that I was deeply inspired by the faith and perseverance of those who I met and by all of the people that were there -- so many people.
And unfortunately, now we're getting ready to respond to Hurricane Irma. And these incredible people that we have at FEMA and the other groups, they thought they'd get a night of sleep -- one night, just one night. They're not getting anything. They're right now going to Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and they're already there.
And they're being hit with some very, very strong and powerful winds. The winds coming now -- Irma, they're saying, is the largest one in recorded history in the Atlantic Ocean -- coming out of the Atlantic, which gets big ones.
So I just want to thank everybody and all of the people that are going down. And they're really now, again, in harm's way. We'll work together to help save lives, protect families, and support those in need. Together, we will recover and we will rebuild.
I also want to tell the people of North Dakota and the Western states who are feeling the pain of the devastating drought that we are with you 100 percent -- 100 percent. [Applause] And I've been in close touch, numerous times, with our Secretary of Agriculture, who is doing a fantastic job, Sonny Perdue, who has been working with your governor and your delegation to help provide relief. And we're doing everything we can, but you have a pretty serious drought.
I just said to the governor, I didn't know you had droughts this far north. Guess what? You have them. But we're working hard on it and it'll disappear. It will all go away.
I want you to know we'll always stand strong and unified with our farmers and our ranchers -- the backbone of America -- that I can tell you, 100 percent. [Applause]
So we're here today to talk about our plan to create a new age of American prosperity by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. The taxes are crazy -- the highest-taxed nation in the world. We're going to turn that around very quickly. [Applause]
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I mean that. I think this is one time you're going to get. And I'm honored to be joined by some of the fantastic leaders who share this goal with us.
Senator Hoeven. Where is Senator? Senator, stand up, Senator. [Applause] Doing a fantastic job. Come on up, Senator. Come on up here. Get up here. Fantastic job. Thank you, Senator.
Governor Burgum. [Applause] Come on up, Governor. Beautiful job. Come on. Lieutenant Governor Sanford. [Applause] The Governor told me he's the best lieutenant governor in the country. So I don't know. We'll check it out. Congressman Cramer. [Applause]  Senator Heitkamp. Senator, come on up. [Applause]
And I have to say, they -- you are all in favor of tax cuts, aren't you? Come on up, Senator. These are great people. They work hard. They're for you 100 percent. And we just want their support because we need support.
You see that with what's happening in Congress. Nobody can get anything through Congress. We need support.
So thank you, Senator. Senator Heitkamp. Everyone is saying, what's she doing up here? But I'll tell you what -- good woman, and I think we'll have your support. I hope we'll have your support. And thank you very much, Senator. Thank you for coming up. Senators, thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
They're all in good company together. By working together, we're going to restore America's competitive edge by passing tax cuts and reform that makes America the best place in the world to hire, invest, and to grow. We love our country, we love our people, and we want to create more jobs in America, for Americans.
I want to welcome a great friend and a true American visionary who has created thousands of jobs in North Dakota and all around the country, and he's been a friend of mine right from the beginning.
He said I should do this; absolutely you have to do it. A great, great American success story -- Harold Hamm. Where is Harold? Where is Harold? Come here, Harold. [Applause] Thousands and thousands of jobs.
You know, Barry Switzer was up at my office. And I never heard this -- you probably have heard this, but Harold was a little bit late and Barry was talking to me. And Barry is a great guy, great football coach. I think he won a Super Bowl and a college number one, right?
And we were talking about Harold, who is a great friend of his. And he said, ""You know that guy
He said, ""That guy -- these companies spend billions of dollars and they're looking for oil and they don't find anything. Harold Hamm
You find oil in North Dakota, in the Bakken! [Applause]
Thank you, Harold.
North Dakota is an inspiring example of the amazing things that are possible when we unleash the genius of American innovators, unite the red tape, and I'll tell you -- and we have to unite everything.
And all that red tape becomes beautiful when you get rid of it. And we're getting rid of -- are we getting rid of a lot of red tape, by the way? [Applause] And we unlock the extraordinary potential of our great American workers.
North Dakota chose to embrace American industry and the American worker even when many in Washington wanted to tax and regulate your industries totally out of existence. And you knew that. And you've seen what's happened over the last number of eight months. You've seen what's happened. Big difference.
Today, families have new jobs and new hope because of the vast energy wealth that you brought to life right here. You understand the vital truth: Washington has no right to shut down energy production because America's energy wealth doesn't belong to the government, it belongs to the people. [Applause]
It belongs to hardworking patriots like you because of the North Dakota energy miracle -- and I call it a miracle. Today, this state has the lowest unemployment rate of any state in America, nearly half the national average. [Applause]
I want all of America to be inspired by what's happened in North Dakota and the North Dakota example. This state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing American jobs -- which has been happening, believe me. [Applause]
And, by the way, Ivanka Trump -- everybody loves Ivanka. [Applause] Come up, honey. Should I bring Ivanka up? [Applause] Come up. Sometimes they'll say, ""You know
Now, come on up, honey. She's so good. She wanted to make the trip. She said, Dad, can I go with you? She actually said, Daddy, can I go with you? I like that, right? Daddy, can I go with you? I said, yes, you can.
Where you going? North Dakota. Said, oh, I like North Dakota. Hi, honey. [Applause] Say something, baby.
Hi, North Dakota. [Applause] We love this state, so it's always a pleasure to be back here. And you treated us very, very well in November and have continued to, so we like sharing the love back. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you, honey. Thanks, baby. Come. [Applause] And she means it, believe me.
Since my very first day in office, I've moved at record pace -- and really we have gone at a record pace -- to eliminate the barriers that have been holding back our economy. You've seen it -- so many jobs, the stock market is at new highs. We're getting rid of one job-killing regulation after another. We've lifted the restrictions on shale oil.
We've lifted those restrictions on energy of all types. We're putting our miners back to work. We've cancelled restrictions on oil and natural gas. We've ended the EPA intrusion into your jobs and into your lives. [Applause] And we're refocusing the EPA on its core mission: clean air and clean water. [Applause]
That's what I want -- clean air. Think of it. We talk about the -- I want beautiful clean air, and I want crystal-clean water, right? That's what we want.
In order to protect American industry and workers, we withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. Job killer. People have no idea. [Applause] Many people have no idea how bad that was.
And right here in North Dakota, the Dakota Access Pipeline is finally open for business. [Applause] Now, what other politician, if elected President, would have done that one? They would have stayed so far away.
And I did it immediately, and I didn't even do it in that case for jobs. It was the right thing to do. And that is flowing now beautifully. So it was the right thing to do. [Applause]
We opened it despite so many people that were on the other side calling and asking for this not to happen: Please, we don't want it to happen. I said, why? They didn't know. There was no -- they just didn't want it to happen.
So I did that. I also did Keystone. You know about Keystone. [Applause] Another other one, big one -- big. First couple of days in office, those two -- 48,000 jobs. Tremendous thing. I think environmentally better. I really believe that -- environmentally better.
So I'm keeping my promises to the American people. I do what's right. That's all. I just do what's right. I don't think about it. I do what's right. [Applause]
We're seeing the results all across the country. Already, unemployment is near a 16-year low. African American unemployment is at its lowest point since almost the turn of the millennium. Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers is at an all-time high. That's something I'm very proud of. And they're moving back. [Applause]
I tell you, the companies are moving back. The car companies are coming back. They're going back into Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and lots of places -- Kentucky. Car companies -- they are moving back.
They got to move back, because why should we be allowing other countries to make it -- sell their cars, no cost, just put them right through our borders, cause us unemployment? It's not happening that way, believe.
And it's going to be more and more so, because, you know, like you have to cut through red tape to do things? Hard to believe, I have to cut through red tape to do things too. They have it set. And I'll tell you, America is back -- and it's back right on track, where it should be. And it's happening day after day after day.
And we have certain areas where you have to give notice of 90 days before you can touch an act or before you can touch an executive order. Then you have to wait another 30 days, and then another 90 days. Well, believe me, all of those days are coming up and tremendous numbers of regulations have been cut.
But soon, you're going to see even more. And we're going to have regulation because regulation is not bad, but you don't need 25 times what you're supposed to have. So we're going to have sensible regulation. [Applause]
But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we reform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome -- I mean, this is so complicated and so burdensome -- our tax code.
Our painful tax system has become a massive barrier to America's economic comeback. It really is; we're penalized. It costs us millions of American jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and on compliance. Our tax code is a giant self-inflicted economic wound.
In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at an average of only around 2 percent, and some would say less than that. When I talk to the leaders of other countries -- I speak to them all the time -- they're unhappy about seven or eight points of growth -- GDP.
I spoke to a leader of a major, major country recently --big, big, country -- they say our country is very big, it's hard to grow. Well, believe me, this country is very big.
How are you doing, I said. Because I have very good relationships -- believe it or not -- with the leaders of these countries. I said, ""How are you doing?"""" He said
Our -- if you look at our number when we first got in, we were hitting one-percent numbers and nobody even talks about it. Well, last quarter, we hit 3 percent GDP. [Applause] And I'll tell you what, a lot of that had to do with the cutting of the regulation, and I think a lot of it had to do with optimism.
There's a lot of optimism now. People are starting business that they had no idea they were going to start a year ago.
If we sustain 3 percent growth instead of 2 percent -- only one point; and I think we have a long way to grow; I know we have a long way to grow -- that means 12 -- think of it, one point -- 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion of new economic activity over the next decade. Think of it -- $10 trillion. [Applause]
And if we ever went to 4 percent, think of that, or 5 percent, or 6 percent -- let's see what happens. They were all sort of smiling when I said 3 percent. I must say, we came -- we hit the number faster than I thought, but we hit 3 percent last quarter.
If we want to renew our prosperity, restore our opportunity, and reestablish our economic dominance -- which is what we should be doing -- when we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, pro-American. [Applause]
And anybody that is going to vote against tax cuts and tax reforms -- whether it's in North Dakota or anybody else, or anyplace else -- you got to vote against them and get them out of office because it is so bad. [Applause] This is not a close one.
My administration is working with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and middle-class families all across the nation. So it's not only business taxes, it's middle-income families, it's families at every level -- every level, tax cuts.
Our tax plan represents a sharp reversal from the failed policy of the past. America's high tax rates punish companies for doing business in America and encourages them to move to other countries. That's why you see in so many states, including here for a period of time -- now people are starting to stay and companies are staying -- they'd leave for Mexico and for other places, just routinely.
Well, we've stopped it and we are stopping it. We're not going to let it happen. There has to be a price to pay when that happens; when they let our people go and that happens, and they think they can sell the product right back into the USA. There is going to be a big price to pay, and there has been, and that's why you're seeing a big change.
These Washington policies have pushed industries and companies offshore, who then import their goods back into America and lay off their workers in the process. We end up with nothing. Not going to happen.
My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we've embraced a new model -- it's called the American model. Very simple: The American model. [Applause]
Under the American model, we're reducing the burdens of our businesses -- as long as they do business in our country. We want them to do business -- made in the USA -- we want them to do business in our country. We want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and towns.
That is how we will all succeed and grow together -- as one team, one people, and one American family. It's love. One American family. [Applause]
We're going to go get into great detail over the next two weeks, but we're working on it with Congress now, and coming up with very exacting numbers. But here are my four basic principles for tax reform:
First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand -- unlike what we have. [Applause] Our tax code has gotten ridiculously complex. This complexity leads to massive frustration, wasted time, and wasted money. Lots of wasted money.
Today, the average taxpayer has to wade through 241 pages of instructions to file a basic tax form. Does anyone know that? Two hundred and forty-one pages.
A staggering 94 percent of the families need professional help to do their taxes -- they have to get it -- which is why the tax preparation industry generated $10 billion in revenues last year. That's one business I want to drive down. Sorry. [Applause, Laughter] H&R Block will not be supporting Donald Trump, I can tell you. [Laughter]
Taxpayers spend 6 billion hours each year complying with the tax code. That's why we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. Under our plan, 95 percent of Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a single page without having to keep receipts, fill out schedules, or track endless paperwork. We're giving hardworking Americans their time back, and we're giving them their money back. [Applause]
Second, we will cut taxes for middle-class families. This is a major, major tax cut -- the biggest since Ronald Reagan. [Applause] The pipefitters and plumbers, and nurses, and police officers -- all the people like you who pour their hearts into every penny earned in both the offices and oilfields of America.
You're the ones who carry this nation on your back, and it's time for you to get the relief that you deserve. It's enough. It's enough. [Applause]
That's why our tax plan will reduce taxes for our middle class, and allow them to keep more of their own money -- keep that hard-earned money where you can spend it the way you want to spend it, or guess what? You can also save it. Nothing wrong with that. But it's your money, not the government's money. [Applause]
So we will provide tax relief to middle-income families through a combination of benefits, such as raising their standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit, and lowering tax rates substantially. [Applause]
Third, we need a tax code that restores our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Our plan will provide tax relief to businesses of all sizes. And we will cut the business tax rate as much as possible. Ideally, we would like to bring our business tax rate down to around 15 percent. That's a tremendous drop. [Applause]
All told, it will be the greatest tax reduction in the history of our country. Greater than ever before. So that's going to be something. You'll see a rocket ship. You will see something happen like you've never seen.
But we'll also dramatically reduce the tax rate for America's small businesses which have created more than 60 percent of new private-sector jobs in the recent past. Tax relief is on the way for millions of sole proprietors, LLCs, and partnerships who report their income to their personal -- and they do this -- they put it on their personal tax returns.
People think of it as a business, but it's on their personal tax returns. Those people, with those businesses, will be tremendous beneficiaries. [Applause] Sounds like many of you have those businesses.
Tax reform will also benefit mid-sized businesses, like North Dakota Guaranty and Title Company in Mandan. You know that company, anybody? [Applause] President Nick Hacker -- where's Nick Hacker? Hello, Nick. How are you, Nick? How's business? All right? Getting better all the time.
He says that he spends a fortune on accountants to navigate our complicated tax system. We know the feeling; everybody here knows the feeling. Like millions of other American businesses, he would much rather spend that money on higher wages for his 140 employees.
Workers in the energy sector -- thank you. You have a lot of friends here, Nick. [Laughter] The workers in the energy sector will benefit enormously as well. North Dakota State Senator Jessica Unruh -- where's Jessica? Where's Jessica? [Applause]
Hello, Jessica. Congratulations. Doing a good job, right? That's what I hear -- who is also an environmental specialist says lower business taxes will be a catalyst for energy companies to hire countless of new American workers. So important.
We'll also protect small businesses and family farmers here in North Dakota and across the country by ending the death tax. [Applause] Tremendous burden for the family farmer. Tremendous burden.
Thank you, Donald Trump!
Thank you, appreciate it. But a tremendous burden for small businesses and businesses that aren't necessarily liquid, but they're great businesses -- where you're forced to sell and terrible things happen.
Here with us today is Julie Ellingson, a fourth-generation cattle rancher and a mother of five from Bismarck. Where is Julie? Hello, Julie. [Applause]
Like many family ranchers, Julie worries about the death tax shutting down her family business and keeping her from passing it on to her children. It's a devastating tax. Julie: We are not going to allow the death tax or the inheritance tax or the whatever-you-want-to-call-it to crush the American Dream. Not going to let it happen, so -- fighting hard. [Applause] Thank you, Julie.
Ronald Reagan proved that cutting taxes on American businesses helps American workers win in the world marketplace. When President Reagan lowered taxes, American businesses beat out our foreign competition. Our economy boomed, the middle class thrived, and median family income increased.
But then Washington stood by while other countries adopted our playbook. But they did it even better than us. They lowered their tax rates and reformed their tax systems to be more competitive substantially than that of the United States of America. And America went from leading the pack to following way behind.
Now our business tax rate is the highest in the developed world -- 60 percent higher than our foreign competitors. Pretty bad. Puts us at a big disadvantage. We're behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Japan, Ireland, Mexico, behind South Korea. We're dead last.
Our high business tax is nothing more than a crushing tax on every product made in America. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. But we're not surrendering any more. [Applause]
We're going to reduce the tax rate on American business so they can keep our jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America, meaning higher wages and greater profits for companies. [Applause] It's finally time to give the American worker a pay raise. That's what we're going to do. [Applause]
And finally, we must bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas and just can't come back. Our tax system penalizes companies that bring wealth they have earned overseas back to America.
As a result, corporations have parked trillions of dollars in foreign countries -- money that could be and should be brought back into the United States where it can be invested in America companies, in American jobs, and American workers.
Our tax plan will give these companies a chance to bring back these funds -- and bring them back and spend it in cities and towns all across our country. The numbers you're talking about are staggering. [Applause]
The numbers we're talking about are probably between $3.5 trillion and $5 trillion that cannot come back into our -- and think of it, the Democrats want it to come back. The Republicans want it to come back. They have for years, and nothing gets done. We're going to get it done. [Applause]
We're going to be switching from a worldwide tax system that encourages companies to keep their funds offshore to a territorial system that encourages companies to bring their profits back home to America where that money belongs. It is our time to invest in our country. We want to build our communities, and we want to build beautiful new ones.
And we want to rebuild the old ones. And we want to hire -- and you may have heard the term once or twice before -- the fact is we want to -- just like that beautiful man's hat -- we want to make America great again. Good hat. [Applause]
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America's competitive edge. History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome and unstoppable than the will of the American people. You saw that on November 8th. Believe me, you saw that on November 8th. [Applause]
If you demand it, and if you call up people in Congress -- good people, sometimes maybe not the right intention, but good people -- Congress will deliver on it because they have no choice.
So you have to call your congressmen. You have to call your senators. You have to make sure that they do what they have to do. And believe me, we haven't given up on healthcare. We haven't given up on healthcare. We never give up. [Applause]
One vote. One vote. Think of it -- one vote. Terrible. A terrible situation took place that night. We can't let that happen again. We cannot let that happen again.
But we'll get it done one way or the other. But only if you demand it, only if you, the American people, tell Congress to stop putting party first and start putting America first. Only then will it happen. [Applause]
You can remind them that both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic Speaker, and a vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota. So it can happen. [Applause]
You listening, Heidi? Yes, Heidi is listening. Yeah, she heard that. Thank you, Heidi. We're not going to put her on the spot. I'm not putting her on the spot. [Laughter]
If Democrats don't want to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, raise your pay, and help America win, voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America, or find a new job. Do something else. Just do something else. [Applause]
I'm asking all Americans -- Republican, Democrat, and independent -- to join with me, with each other, to demand tax cuts and tax reform that will put America first. We're going to put America first. It's time. [Applause]
We no longer have to accept a tax code that lets special interests win at the expense of the middle class. We no longer have to accept a rigged system -- you know all about rigged systems; we talked about that plenty of times in the campaign.
You think anything is so different? But we're going to make it different. We're going to get that straightened out too -- that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas, and punishes them for investing in America. They actually get punished under the tax code for investing in our country.
It's going to all change. We can heal this self-inflicted wound and we can reestablish our economic dominance all over the world. We can give our workers the level playing field they deserve, and they will win. Because if the fight is fair, no one on Earth can beat the American worker or the American company -- nobody, nobody. [Applause]
When we do, store shelves all across the country -- those shelves, they're going to be so packed -- all around the world will be lined once again with products proudly bearing the words: Made in the USA.
So do you remember, when we were growing up, it was either ""Made in America"""" or """"Made in the USA""""? What do you like better? Ready? """"Made in America."""" """"Made in the USA."""" What do you like? [Applause]""
You like ""Made in the USA""""? [Applause] Seems to be. We should pick one or the other
There was such pride in that label, such incredible pride. And it's coming back again. Believe me, it's coming, because the quality of what we do is second to none.
If America comes together, if the people speak with one voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across our great land, we will bring back the American Dream. Bring it back.
I want to thank the people of North Dakota who have been so incredible to me. I have so many friends here. I have so many people that I respect from this incredible state.
I want to thank you. I want to say God bless you, God bless the American worker, and God bless the United States of America. And I appreciate you being out here today. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much."

The heartbreaking devastation and suffering caused by Hurricane Harvey has profoundly affected our entire nation. Many homes and communities have been destroyed, many lives have been upended and tragically some have lost their lives.
In this catastrophic storm, we pray for the victims and their families and all of those who have been displaced from their homes. At this very moment, heroic efforts continue to keep safe those threatened by this natural disaster.
I want to say a special word of thanks to our amazing first responders, our police and law enforcement officers, firefighters, Coast Guard National Guard, EMS, doctors, nurses, hospital workers and volunteers, who have traveled from all across the country.
Thousands of people have come together to prevent loss of life and ensure safety, and we are incredibly grateful for their courage, their professionalism and their sacrifice. They are an inspiration to all of us.
To the people affected by Hurricane Harvey, we are with you every single step of the way. We will help you recover. We will help you rebuild. We will support you today, tomorrow and the day after. We've been working closely with local authorities, and I remain in close communication with Governor Abbott of Texas and Governor Edwards of Louisiana.
At the request of Governor Abbott, I declared a major disaster to the state of Texas, to ensure that federal aid is available for state and local recovery efforts. I also approved a disaster declaration for Louisiana.
Organizations like the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and faith-based organizations are actively assisting on the ground and they are doing a fantastic job. I want to recognize the millions of citizens across the country who are contributing in every way they can with their time their resources and their prayers.
When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. When we see neighbors in need, we rush to their aid. We don't ask their names or where they're from. We help our fellow Americans every single time. This is the spirit of America. It's exactly what I saw while in Texas this week, a spirit of love, determination and resolve, a spirit that, even when wounded, never gives up, never gives in, never loses hope.
We just keep fighting. We just keep pushing on for the people we love and for the nation we call home. All American hearts are with the people of Texas and Louisiana. We mourn and pray and struggle through the hardships together. We know that a long and difficult path lies ahead to get our neighbors back in their homes and on their feet.
But we also know that we are stronger than the obstacles in our path. Arm and arm, we will strive, we will endure and we will emerge stronger than ever before. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."

[Applause] Thank you very much. It's so nice. And we appreciate it. And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag -- believe me, we appreciate it very much.
I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney -- [Applause] -- and all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. Where is Jerry? Where is Jerry? [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. What a job. I've heard so much about you. It's a great honor to know you, Jerry. Thank you.
I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. [Applause] Thank you, Steve. Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. [Applause] Small Business Administrator -- which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that -- Linda McMahon, a friend of mine. [Applause]
And from the purely political world, a really great friend who did such an incredible job with his beautiful wife at the inauguration, Senator Roy Blunt. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Where's Roy? Thank you, Roy.
Governor Greitens is here, who is doing some job. [Applause] Thank you, Governor. Special. Lieutenant Governor Parson. Lieutenant Governor, thank you, Lieutenant Governor. And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming. There are so many. I was asking the Governor and Roy, I said, do you think I should announce them all? I have so many. But I'm honored that they're here.
Representative Sam Graves. [Applause] Representative Vicky Hartzler, who has been terrific. [Applause] My friend for a long time, and just somebody that he liked me from the beginning and I liked him, Billy Long. Where's Billy? [Applause] Billy. Right, Billy? Right from the beginning. Blaine Luetkemeyer -- where's Blaine? Good. Thank you, Blaine. [Applause] Representative Jason Smith. [Applause] Jason, thank you for everything, Jason. Representative Ann Wagner. Hi, Ann. Good job, Ann. [Applause]

Before we begin, Iâd like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion. Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property. Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harmâs way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives. They represent truly the very best of America. [Applause]
We must be vigilant. We must protect the lives of our people. I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott -- who is doing, by the way, and incredible job -- and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger. And together, we will endure and we will overcome. [Applause]
To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room -- every step of the way. [Applause]
To those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever. The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.
As our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people -- people -- great, great people -- all affected by this tragedy. We're also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri. [Applause]
And I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in -- can I say ""Missouri
This is the place where the ""Main Street of Americaâ got its start
We're here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. [Applause] Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. And you have seen what's happening with regulations -- they're going fast. We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they're going fast. [Applause]
That is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years. I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker -- and pro-American. [Applause]
There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. [Applause]
And, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump -- I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience. Stand up, honey. [Applause] She's working very hard. I'm very proud of Ivanka.
For many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit. The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of Americaâs booming industry. Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce. Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West.
And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that do it. [Applause] Stand up. Stand up Mr. Cook. Stand up. [Applause] I think they like you. And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And it wasn't pleasant to watch, especially for me. I would sit back -- I was in business -- and I could see what was happening. It wasn't good.
If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. [Applause]
In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year. If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's seven, eight, nine. And I speak to them -- leaders of the countries -- how are you doing? ""Not well
And today -- a very appropriate day that this should happen -- we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP. It just came out. [Applause] And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent. So we're really on our way.
If we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade. That's some numbers. [Applause] And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. There's no reason why we shouldnât. [Applause]
So this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don't want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me? Do you understand? [Applause]
Congress -- I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so. [Laughter] I tell you what, the United States is counting on it. [Applause]
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. [Applause] That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.
Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses. At the time, it was really something special.
Since then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable. Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans.
In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions. Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and it's pretty complex stuff. The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.
This enormous complexity is very unfair. It disadvantages ordinary Americans who donât have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests. And most importantly, this is wrong. [Applause] Thank you.
First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families. [Applause] That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes -- and I'm speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you. And I might be speaking against Mr. Cook, and we're both okay with it, is that right?
It's crazy. We're speaking -- maybe we shouldn't be doing this, you know? [Laughter] But we're doing the right thing. [Applause] True. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.
Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Itâs time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for for many, many years. [Applause]
In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent. That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time. Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened. But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully -- right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family income increased.
Other countries saw the success. They looked at us. They saw -- what is America doing? What's happening with the United States? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us. They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners. So we must -- we have no choice -- we must lower our taxes.
And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. And if she doesn't do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office. [Applause] She's got to make that commitment. She's got to make that commitment. If she doesn't do it, you just can't do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists.
If we don't get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever -- we are looking for the biggest ever -- jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. But, at a minimum, they won't take off the way they should.
The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Not one vote. We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare.
The strategy of our economic rivals has worked. They made their taxes lower -- and far lower, in many cases, than ours -- and jobs left our country. Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where they'd make massive profits, and they wouldnât be paying tax to us either.
So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We got nothing but unemployment. We got nothing.
Other businesses -- even classic American brands -- switched their headquarters to foreign countries. Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past.
Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent -- going up to 80 percent -- on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time. [Applause] He has done some job. A whole different world out there right now.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and itâs way more than that. And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits -- numbers that you would not believe.
But this administration is going to fix that. One by one, we're fixing it. We're working right now on NAFTA -- the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we're working on it. Let's see what happens. [Applause]
Mexico is not happy. [Laughter] But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone. We got to change this deal. And hopefully we can renegotiate it. But if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal. [Applause]
So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe that? So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind.
We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. We have totally surrendered. We're not surrendering anymore. [Applause]
Ideally -- and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury -- we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world. But it would make us highly competitive.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors.
We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America -- the America we love. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much.
Because when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA. [Applause]
When I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA. You don't see it anymore. We're going to go back to Made in the USA -- Made in the USA."" [Applause] ""
The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families. [Applause] In a way -- and Iâve been saying this for a long time -- they've been sort of the forgotten people, but they're not forgotten any longer. I can tell you that. [Applause]
We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means theyâll go out, and theyâll spend their money. And it will be a beautiful thing to watch.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family. That's so important to Ivanka Trump. [Applause] Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter. Itâs one of her real big beliefs. And sheâs very committed to that. Right, Ivanka?
We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it. [Applause]
So theyâll keep their money. Theyâll spend their money. Theyâll buy our product. Our factories will be moving again. Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat -- it says: Make America Great Again. That's what we're going to do. [Applause] Right?
Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there.
The amount of money we're talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that? By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
Itâs time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers. [Applause]
My administration is embracing a new economic model. Itâs called very simply: The American Model. Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny. [Applause]
So today Iâm calling on all members of Congress -- Democrat, Republican and independent -- to support pro-American tax reform. They have to do it. Itâs time. [Applause] They have to do it. It is time.
Iâm calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. [Applause]
What could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much? [Applause]
So letâs put -- or at least try to put -- the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. [Applause]
If we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long. Itâs time. [Applause]
Products made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world. It's true. [Applause] Itâs time. Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods. [Applause] Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America. Weâll have it both ways.
Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work. They will love getting up in the morning. They will love going to their job. They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck. They will be proud again. [Applause]
That is the future I want for our people. That is the future I want for America -- a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free.
Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things -- beautiful things -- for our country. I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing Americaâs full potential. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people.
And if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again.
Thank you. God bless you. [Applause] God bless you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Governor, thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."
2017-08-25,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-august-25-2017,"My fellow Americans. I had the profound honor this week of addressing American troops at Fort Myer, and speaking to thousands of veterans at the American Legion National Convention. Today, I want to speak to all Americans about what we can learn from the men and women of our incredible Armed Forces.
Every person who puts on the uniform makes our nation proud. They all come from across our land. They represent every race, ethnicity and creed. But they all pledge the same oath, fight the same cause, and operate as one team with one shared sense of purpose.
They love their families. They cherish their freedom. They salute our flag, and above all they believe in America. Now, we must draw inspiration from their love and loyalty to one another and to our nation.
As we seek to heal divisions from within, we must also remember what our service personnel know better than anyone: that we are one people, with one home, and one glorious American destiny.
We come from all different walks of life, but we all share the same dream: to live in peace and safety, to work with honor and dignity, and to build a better future for those we love.
Together we can achieve this dream, but we must first remember who we are and the values that bind us together. We must speak out against the voices that try to sow hatred and division. We must treat our fellow citizens with love and affection, and we must honor our heroes and prove worthy of the sacrifice they've made.
For all of us, I ask every American to make a simple promise to the courageous warriors who fight in our name: when they come home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of loyalty that unite us together as one.
Only when we work together with a shared purpose will we carry on the proud tradition of those who came before us. Only when we honor our history will we have confidence in our few, and only when we strive for peace among one another will we remain a force for peace all around the world.
We can achieve this peace. We can foster this unity, and we can rebuild this loyalty because together we are truly one nation under God. Thank you. God bless you."
2017-08-23,President Trump Gives Remarks to the National Convention of the American Legion,"Reno, NV, United States","[-119.8138027, 39.5296329]",donald-trump-speech-american-legion-reno-nevada-august-23-2017,"Thank you, Commander Schmidt, for that wonderful introduction and for your steadfast devotion to our country. I want to thank all of our distinguished guests with us today, including HUD Secretary Ben Carson, VA Secretary David Shulkin and former Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates.
Where is Bob Gates? Bob Gates has been so great, I'll tell you. He started off saying bad things about me, and then he said great things, and now I like him. Thank you Bob.
It's a great honor to be back here with all of my friends at the American Legion at your national convention. I want to thank Governor Sandoval for being here. Dean Heller is here someplace, or will shortly be here. He's caught the first flight out. So I want to thank Dean Heller, Senator for being here.
The American Legion embodies the spirit of patriotism. That is the true source of our strength and the best hope for our future. You love our country, you cherish our values, and you definitely defend our great American flag. No doubt about that. Above all else, you believe in America, just like America believes in you.
Today, wwe are here to honor you for the sacrifices you have made to defend our nation and preserve our way of life, but we're also here for another reason. We are here to hold you up as an example of strength, courage and resolve that our country will need to overcome the many challenges that we face. We are here to draw inspiration from you as we seek to renew the bonds of loyalty that bind us together.
As one people and one nation, those who wear the nation's uniform come from all different backgrounds and from every single walk of life, but they are all united by shared values and a shared sense of duty.
They are all part of one team, with only one mission in mind, most importantly, they're all Americans, and they work together. They fight together and they sacrifice together to defend our magnificent home. Thank you.
Now, our nation must follow that same work ethic, that same devotion to a greater cause to achieve our country's full potential. Here with us today, our veterans, who have fought in every major military engagement dating all the way back to World War II.
You've endured bitter winters, treacherous jungles, barren deserts and stormy waters. You've left your families charged into danger, faced down your enemies and bore the scars and wounds of war. Each of you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. With that oath, you pledged your honor and your very lives for our great nation.
Every veteran here today is part of a long, unbroken chain of American heroes. We salute your service. The American Legion not only remembers history, you helped keep history alive. You teach young Americans to have pride in our history so that they will have confidence in our future history and culture, so important, for generations.
Now the American Legion has taught our young people the principles of Americanism. You emphasized the need to preserve the nation's cultural, moral and patriotic values. You encouraged the observation of patriotic holidays. You stressed the need to enforce our laws, including our immigration laws.
You teach the responsibilities of citizenship and the importance of the Pledge of Allegiance, so important, and you do it all, as your motto says, for God and country. That's why we're here today, for America and for God, but to fulfill our patriotic duties. We must take care of our great veterans
One year ago at this gathering, and I remember so many of you so well, I promised you that I would make it my priority to fix the broken, VA and deliver for our veterans the care they so richly deserve, and you see what's been happening now. You have a true reformer in Secretary David Shulkin, he has done an incredible job.
He's working night and day to implement the 10-point reform plan that I discussed with you last year. Already we have made incredible progress. We are publishing wait times online for every VA facility, so you know what the wait is. We've delivered same-day emergency mental health services at every VA Medical Center.
We've opened the promised White House VA hotline. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. We've dramatically increased the number of veterans approved to see the doctor of their choice and signed legislation to continue that very important choice program that I spoke to you about last year.
And I want to thank the American Legion for your help in getting this done. You have been so helpful. Thank you very much. Something that they've been trying to pass for 40 years, and we've passed, VA Accountability legislation.
So if somebody that works at the VA is bad to the people of the VA, disrespectful, not treating our fellow patriots, well, we look at them and we say, you're fired. That's it! That's it. They don't do a good job they're out, because we want people to have great people at the VA, but we want people that do a great job.
We weren't able to do that before. That was a hard piece of legislation to get passed. It's been worked on for so long. We got it done, so we're very proud of that. Last week, I also signed the Harry W Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act. That's a big thing. This legislation bears the name of one of the first members of the Legion.
Your past commander, a man who wrote the original draft of the first landmark GI Bill in 1944, and now under this legislation, veterans can use their GI benefits at any point in their lifetime. Some difference. And in just a few moments right here on this stage, I will sign another historic bill that the American Legion helped us deliver.
Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, and you all know what that means. No longer will veterans be kept waiting for years to get an answer to their appeals. They will receive timely updates and they will get decisions much more quickly, in a fraction of the time. And the Legion, I have to say, pressed so hard for that legislation.
So I want to thank you very much. I want to thank you. I want to thank you so much. You really helped. They have a lot of power, a lot of power, and they use it well. When I spoke to you last year, I also promised that we would build up our military, and that's exactly what we have done.
I am proud to report that we have worked with Congress to achieve a dramatic increase in defense spending this year. We are committed to expanding and improving a state-of-the-art missile defense system to shoot down missiles in flight, and we're getting better and better and better at it.
It's actually incredible what's taking place, and we will develop new surveillance and long-range strike capabilities to prevent our enemies from launching them in the first place. In every foreign policy decision... [Applause] thank you.
In every foreign policy decision, we are making clear that we will always put the safety and security of our citizens first. That is why, early this week, I announced a new strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia. We will pursue an honorable and enduring outcome in Afghanistan worthy of the tremendous sacrifice our troops have already made.
We will give our men and women in uniform the tools they need and the trust they have earned to fight and to win. And we have made, as you have been reading, and seeing, tremendous progress in the fight against terrorism. Just over a month ago in Iraq, Mosul was liberated from the barbaric rule of ISIS.
We are stripping terrorists of their territory at a record clip. Their funding, their networks, and the false allure of their ideology. And I will tell you, we're gonna start working very hard on the Internet, because they're using the Internet at a level that they should not be allowed to use the Internet.
They're recruiting from the Internet, and we are going to work under my administration very hard so that doesn't happen. No longer are we using our military to build democracies. Instead, we're forming a coalition of nations that share the aim of stamping out extremism, defeating terrorism and pursuing stability, prosperity and peace through the generations.
America has always prevailed, not by military might alone, but also by the strength of our spirit, and we have in this country today such spirit. I see it when I meet the people backstage, they're so proud.
Once again, I must say, much more proud than they were last year at this time. They are feeling very good about our country, very, very good about our country, because our people have always had that will to endure and to overcome. This is now the challenge of our times.
We must ask ourselves who we are, what we stand for and what, together, we can achieve. If American patriots could secure our independence, carve out a home in the wilderness and free millions from tyranny and oppression around the world, then that same spirit of strength, courage and resolve can help us create a better future for our people today.
A future like even our people have never had before in this great country. That's what we're aiming for. We don't have to be content with a dilapidated road system, with crumbling buildings or rusted-out factories. We can build gleaming new highways, state-of-the-art manufacturing, and modern works of wonder, and we can do it all with American workers and American iron, aluminium and steel.
We can do it ourselves. We do not have to accept the economic decay of once thriving hubs of industry where they leave, and they let all those jobs go, and those companies move to other countries. We've stopped that flow and companies are now coming back into the United States, and I am so proud of that.
We can bring new jobs to Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore and help struggling communities thrive and dream and prosper. We do not need to limit the potential of our children by trapping them in failing government schools. Every child should have the chance to explore their talents, pursue their passions and know the joy of achieving their ambitions.
And we will never tolerate crime in our cities, bloodshed in our communities or acts of hatred or terrorism against our citizens. We will not stand for it
We will always support our great law enforcement personnel. These are great people, build bridges of trust and cooperation and keep our families safe. It is time to heal the wounds that divide us and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us. We are one people with one home and one great flag.
We are not defined by the color of our skin, the figure on our paycheck, or the party of our politics. We are defined by our shared humanity by our citizenship in this magnificent nation and by the love that fills our hearts.
And I know I speak for all of you when I say our hearts beat for America. Our souls fill with pride every time we hear the national anthem. This is the spirit we need to overcome our challenges: to pursue our common destiny, and to achieve a brighter future for our people.
We will win. Watch, we will win. This is the future. We can build together if we have the courage to act, the strength to endure and the patriotism to join together with true affection for our fellow citizen.
I want to close with the story of a hero who defines the spirit of service and sacrifice, a man whose strength, patriotism and courage knows no bounds. A Vietnam veteran who threw himself on top of a grenade to protect his fellow comrades.
This true American hero went on to serve in the National Guard for over 27 years. He is now a retired captain at his local fire department, and owns a funeral home that memorializes our heroes, and he has worked tirelessly to bring another veterans post to Kansas City, so that those who return from combat have a place to go that honors and supports them.
Some of you know this incredible patriot. He's a friend to many in this room. He is with us here today, and he's on stage with us right now: Medal of Honor recipient Donald E. Ballard. [Applause, Off Microphone Talk]
He's got to say a word, right? This wasn't in the planning. Do I have your approval? Come on Don, get up.
There is no greater love than someone that loves this country, and I believe we've elected the right leader to lead us out, to drain the swamp. [Cheering]
See, that's very risky of me. That could ruin the whole day for me. If he got up and said the opposite, I would be in trouble. So thank you Don, that was very risky. I didn't know what was gonna happen. I had a pretty good idea.
But Don, on behalf of the people of the United States, I want to thank you for your courageous service. You inspire us all today. We are reminded that the greatness of our nation is found in our people, like Don. As long as we have faith in each other and confidence in our values, then there is no challenge too great for us to conquer.
We are people... we are people who love. We are people with heart. We are people who adore. We are people that are great. There is no country like the United States of America. We have no division too deep for us to heal and there is no enemy too strong for us to overcome, because in America, we never lose faith, we never forget who we are, and we never stop striving for a better future.
Together, we cannot fail. We will not fail. We will make America great again, greater than ever before, I promise. So I want to thank you to the American Legion. You talk of greatness, you talk of greatness.
The American Legion is greatness. Thank you very much to our service members and to Don and to everybody in the room. Thank you to our great great veterans. May God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. It's my honor! Thank you. Thank you. [Applause, the bill is signed]
Thank you everybody. [Cheering]"
2017-08-22,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Phoenix, Arizona","Phoenix, AZ, United States","[-112.0740373, 33.4483771]",donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-phoenix-arizona-august-22-2017,"What a crowd. And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you. A lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. They can get them in. Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we'll appreciate it.
And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, for the introduction. As well as my friend Dr. Ben Carson. And thank you to a very, very special man, Franklin Graham, Reverend Franklin Graham, for leading us in prayer. And thank you too Alveda King, the niece of the great Dr. Martin Luther King.
It really shows you that America is indeed a nation of faith, we know that. Well, I'm thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona. With so many thousands of hard-working American patriots.
You know I'd love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. It is incredible. It is incredible. As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right?
The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here. And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. We love those debates.
But we went to center stage and we never left, right? All of us, we did it together. You were there at the start. You've been there every single day since, and I will never forget.
Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget. And I'm here tonight to send a message: We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done. This evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values.
We love our country. We celebrate our troops. We embrace our freedom. We respect our flag. We are proud of our history. We cherish our Constitution, including, by the way, the Second Amendment. [Crowd chants USA] We fully protect religious liberty. We believe in law and order. And we support the incredible men and of law enforcement.
And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God. You always understood what Washington, D.C. did not. Our movement is a movement built on love. It's love for fellow citizens. It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.
From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.
It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing. [Crowd chants USA]
After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women -- remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election? Guess what? They're not forgotten... anymore, right? Anymore.
No, they're not forgotten anymore folks. In fact, they're trying to figure you out. They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us? I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.
Respect for America demands respect for all of its people. Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.
You saw last night. You saw last night. Did anybody watch last night? Yes. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together. We're all together.
It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers. And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers. No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.
That's what we are. We're a team. As a nation, we're a team. They're all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission. It's time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team. We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.
And it's happening, and it's happening fast. I see all those red hats and white hats. It's all happening very fast. It's called ""Make America Great Again."" You see what's going on. It's coming back, very fast. We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.
What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America. And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence. But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras. [Booing]
So the -- and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories. They have no sources in many cases. They say ""a source says"" -- there is no such thing.
But they don't report the facts. Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK. I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.
So what I did -- So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK? I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are. [Booing]
So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville -- and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know. Here's the first -- can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.
Now they know. Now they finally know. But I -- I just -- I don't want to bore you with this, but I -- it shows you how dishonest they are. And most of you know this anyway. So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: ""We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia"" -- this is me speaking.
We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."" That's me speaking on Saturday. Right after the event. So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, ""egregious display,"" ""hatred, bigotry and violence."" OK, I think I can't do much better, right? OK. But they didn't want to put this on.
They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough. He didn't do it on time. Why did it take a day? He must be a racist.
It took a day. [Booing] Dishonest people. So here is -- here is me -- I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.
They don't even do that. The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room. I call them anarchists.
Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists. They don't want to talk about the anarchists. So this is me -- ""it has no place in America."" I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time. This is me speaking.
Here's further. This is on Saturday, the first one. I did this three times. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really"" -- and I say this so strongly -- ""true affection for each other."" I didn't say true affection for you and you. I said for each other, all of us. All of us.
All of us. But they don't report it. They don't -- they just let it go. ""Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first. We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag."" [Crowd chants USA]
And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough. Why wasn't he more specific? So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster? The -- I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.
And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false. If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know. You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.
It's so bad. [Booing] Or the Washington Post, which call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that's a lobbying tool for Amazon. Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down. [Booing] Right? [Crowd chants CNN Sucks]
But all the networks -- I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning -- I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right? Little George. And -- and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?
They had a hard time. They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing -- we were saying things -- and it really did.
So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, ""Let's get back to Charlottesville."" Charlottesville. And Nikki was great. She's doing a great job, by the way.
So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country. I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people. It says I love all of the people of our country.
I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden. I love all the people of our country. So, I said here's my -- this is -- by the way folks, this is my exact words: ""I love all the people of our country.
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America."" And then they say, is he a racist? Is he a racist? Then, I did a second one. So then I did a second one. Don't bother, it's only a single voice.
And not a very powerful voice. How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside. How about -- how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.
Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm.
You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything -- Antifa! So on August the 14th -- so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?
Now I figure I'm going to do it again. I'll be even more specific. So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.
Because that was right after the event, the first one, right? An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered. That's what I said.
Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that. They don't show it. They take -- they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.
He was late. So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence. OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.
We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right? Then I said, racism is evil. Do they report that I said that racism is evil? You know why? Because they are very dishonest people. So I said, racism is evil.
Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.
But, I mean do you ever see anything -- and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.
And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord. I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.
They said, we've better get out of here; we can't have that. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.
Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness? And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right.
He doesn't have to say... [Booing] You know why? Because they have a double standard. Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.
You never heard them say that. And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized. But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.
And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on. ""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America."" These are my words. This was on Monday, August 14th.
So you had Saturday; you had Monday. You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right. ""In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.
Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice."" And then I finished, I said, ""We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans."" All is capitalized times five. Not just you.
And we will work together so that every citizen -- every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls. OK now, I mean -- so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.
I hit him with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi.
I got them all in there, let's say. KKK, we have KKK. I got them all.
So they're having a hard time. So what are they say, right? It should have been sooner. He's a racist.
It should have been sooner, OK. So it should have been -- so then the last one, on Tuesday -- Tuesday I did another one: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
It has no place in America."" But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.
But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words. ""The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing."" They said I didn't mention it. And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States? Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.
But, they asked me the question. And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact. I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done -- over one million since I've been in office...
Way over one million. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. I do.
I do. And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right? They haven't gone up for a long time.
I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.
So that was my words. Now, you know, I was a good student. I always hear about the elite.
You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were.
I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great. I think -- you know what? I think we're the elites. They're not the elites.
So the point is -- and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different -- there were two statements and one news conference.
The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don't put on those words.
And they don't put on me saying those words. The media can attack me. But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.
When they attack the decency of our supporters. You are honest, hard-working, taxpaying -- and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down. You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.
It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions. And yes, by the way -- and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage. You see that. [Booing] And -- and I say it, and you know, we're all pros. We're all, like, we have a certain sense. We're smart people.
These are truly dishonest people. And not all of them. Not all of them.
You have some very good reporters. You have some very fair journalists. But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.
And I really think they don't like our country. I really believe that. And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.
If they would change, I would never say it. The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news. Oh, that's so funny.
Look back there, the live red lights. They're turning those suckers off fast out there. They're turning those lights off fast.
Like CNN. CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you. I mean, the advantage I have -- the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.
And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media -- if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out. I probably wouldn't be standing here, right? I probably wouldn't be standing here right now. If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.
And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, ""He's in a Twitter-storm again!"" I -- I don't do Twitter-storms. You know, you'll put out a little tweet: ""I'm going to be with the veterans today."" They'll say, ""Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm.""
These are sick people. You know the thing I don't understand? You would think -- you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.
I honestly believe it. If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth. I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.
How about this? The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.
Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled. And I figured, this is great. And for about two weeks I got good coverage.
Then they reverted back into worse than ever before. You know, it's like one of those things. The Washington Post is terrible.
But these are dishonest -- but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers. You have some great networks. I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.
Fox treated me fairly. They've treated me fairly. Hey, I'll let you know.
You know what? Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK? But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good. I get plenty of bad on Fox, too. But at least it's within reason.
And Hannity? How good is that? How good is Hannity? And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy. And ""Fox and Friends in the Morning"" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch. Not only does -- oh boy, those cameras are going off.
Oh, wow. Why don't you just fold them up and take them home? Oh, those cameras are going off. Wow.
That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen. Now, you know what? I'm a person that wants to tell the truth. I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.
Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.
And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job. My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.
We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe. And how safe are you at a Trump rally? Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started? When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs. They had -- our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.
But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence. Let me tell you, see this room? You've got people outside, but not very many. But see this room? You're safe in this room.
You're very safe in this room. It's a big room. The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.
By the way, I'm just curious. Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe? So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? That's why... He should have had a jury, but you know what? I'll make a prediction.
I think he's going to be just fine, OK? But -- but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy. Is that OK? All right? But Sheriff Joe can feel good. The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.
MS-13 -- we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this. We are liberating towns out on Long Island. We're liberating.
Can you imagine, in this day and age -- in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns. This is like from a different age. We are taking these people.
They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful. They cut them up into little pieces. These are animals.
We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country. We're liberating our towns.
You're seen it. You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it. And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.
That I can tell you. After years of defending other countries borders -- can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders -- we're finally defending our own borders. And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.
And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in. We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country. Including the auto companies who are coming back.
Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.
While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country. We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.
Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector. I was over at the Yuma Sector. It was hot.
It was like 115 degrees. I'm out signing autographs for an hour. I was there.
That was a hot day. You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me. And they actually told me -- actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.
Can you believe that? [Laughter] But it was great. And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people; the job they do. And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.
He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right? That made sense. John, where's John? Where is he? Where's General Kelly? Get him out here. He's great.
He's doing a great job. But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot. We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.
But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.
All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws. And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.
I promised them. I know so many of them. One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.
We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail. We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally. And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary. [Crowd Chants Build that Wall]
Build that wall. Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it. But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.
Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: You are putting all of America's safety at risk. You're doing that. You're doing that.
Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks? I met with a lot of them. And they looked at me, they said, it's vital. It's vital.
It's so vital. And you know, we have walls. I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.
And we want walls that you can see through in a sense. You want to see what's on the other side. But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.
We've done a lot of work. But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls? And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.
It is desperately needed. We're going to have our wall. We're going to get our wall.
And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border. My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control. The American people voted for immigration control.
That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it. So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall. Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.
That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places. Nope.
We're really vetting. We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like -- [Crowd yells No] ""Extreme vetting"" -- I came up with that term.
That's what it has to be. So I have a message for Congress tonight: You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers. That's your job.
You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare -- one vote -- and on every other issue that affects their lives. And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy -- the Senate, remember this -- look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule; we have to. And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.
You're wasting your time. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule. Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.
That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation. We have over 200 bills. [Booing] And we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.
And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators. We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved. They fought.
They really did. They really fought. Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.
It's a trick. We needed 51 votes. But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.
He's the greatest. But you have no margin. But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.
So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines. One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates. It gives competition.
Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down. Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest. You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.
You've got to go to a majority. You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're -- they're just wasting time. All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.
They do one thing well. You know what it's called? They have no ideas. They have no policies.
They obstruct. That's all they do. They're word is, we resist.
They don't resist; they obstruct. It's all they're good at. It's all they're good at.
That's all they do. On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats. We got no votes.
We got no votes. And it would have been great healthcare. And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.
Would have been great. So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing. [Booing]
Under they're plan for America, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country. [Booing]
Obamacare is a disaster and think -- think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace. One vote away. One vote away.
We were one vote away. Think of it, seven years the Republicans -- and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it. [Crowd chanting] But, you know, they all said, Mr.
President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don't mention any names. So I won't.
I won't. No I won't vote -- one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't' it? Very presidential.
And nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him. [Booing] Nobody wants me to talk about him. Nobody knows who the hell he is.
And now -- see, I haven't' mentioned any names. So now, everybody's happy. But we are going to get rid of Obamacare.
I will never stop -- one vote -- I will never stop. We're going to get rid of Obamacare. Every day we're keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans.
Who's a veteran here? It's getting better, getting really good. Nobody's fixed it -- nobody's been able to do it. And remember, I'm only here for less than eight months, you know.
When they talk about Obamacare, it was years. When they talk Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying to get... [Booing] Eight years trying to get health care. [Crowd chanting] Well, it's obvious that we won the state of Arizona, do you agree with that? It's pretty obvious. And we won it by a lot. And I hear we're winning it by even more right now.
But if you think about it, Clinton, they spent eight years that they weren't able to get health care. Other administrations spent all of their time, they weren't able to get it. Obama, what he did to get it.
What he did to get it, including the guy, Gruber. Did you see Gruber got fired yesterday? He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something. Something very bad happened.
Check it out. Something happened. Gruber, who lied about Obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it.
Obamacare is gone. It's a disaster. It's gone.
Premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of Arizona. Insurance companies are fleeing, and it's gone. So we're going to -- I really believe that the Republicans -- and maybe we'll get a couple of senators that think they're going to lose their race on the Democratic side, maybe, but we'll get it fixed.
One vote -- speak to your Senator, please. Speak to your Senator. We're reforming the V.A.
to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice -- choice -- choice. In other words, if you've got to wait for seven days and you're not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor. Isn't that good? And we've got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible.
It's called V.A. Accountability. If somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them.
We say you're fired; get out of here. Everybody said -- everybody said you couldn't get that -- they've been trying to get that passed for 40 years. We got great legislation.
You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten -- I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months,
I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none. So we got V.A. Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.
Isn't that great? We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict. We believe in peace through strength. We're building up our military like never before.
Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy. Last night, as you know, I laid out my vision for I'm honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, Afghanistan.
This is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly United States fans, can I say that? And I will tell you then what we're going to do with our incredible military, they're going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they've already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice.
But we're fighting for them. Our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they've earned to fight and to win.
Fight and to win. And you see what's going on in North Korea. All of a sudden, I don't know -- who knows.
But I can tell you, what I said, that's not strong enough. Some people said it's too strong, it's not strong enough. But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us.
I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact. And maybe -- probably not -- but maybe something positive can come about.
They won't tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about. Every American deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them.
And by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he's now inside, but he said I want to spend my time outside on security.
I said, I think that's a great idea, governor. But not that many people showed up so I don't think it should be much of a problem. But you have a hell of a governor, Governor Ducey.
You have a great governor. And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks. Where is Congressman Franks? Where is he? Get over here.
Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs. Get up here, fellow. Thank you, fellows.
Thank you, congressman. Never let them go, folks. Never let them go.
Don't ever lose them. Thank you, fellows. So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK? For us.
The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp. [Booing]
We need, right now, to drain the swamp. That's what's happening, too, believe me. Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.
But I don't come to Washington for me. You know, I've had a great life. I've had great success.
I've enjoyed my life. Most people think I'm crazy to have done this. And I think they're right.
But I enjoy it, because we've made so much -- I don't believe that any president -- I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months. I really don't believe it. Including -- including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch.
Big [Inaudible]. I came to Washington for you. Your dreams are my dreams.
Your hopes are my hopes. And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. It's so important.
Our agenda is the pro-worker agenda. We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time. We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.
They said we've signed none -- none. We've signed 50; appointed Justice Gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way. So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we're unleashing job-creating American energy like we've never unleashed before.
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal -- meaning, they're taking out coal.
They're going to clean it -- is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one. And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.
How about that? West Virginia. And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party. In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington -- please, don't take his statue down, please.
Please. Does anybody want George Washington's statue? No. Is that sad? Is that all sad? To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.
They're trying to figure out why. They don't know. They're trying to take away our culture.
They are trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.
You go back to a university, and it's gone. Weak, weak people. We are going to protect American industry.
We are going to protect the American worker. No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.
We will buy American, and we will hire American. I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have been a disaster.
And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into. We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA. And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.
You have to see this. We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time. Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.
Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer. Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal. So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK? Probably.
But -- but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA. I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?
You're in -- you're in good hands, I can tell you. We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
People have no idea how bad that was for this country. Great for other countries. We were like the lap dog.
Great for other countries. Our country was so behind. Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.
Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low. Wages are rising. The stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.
Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent. You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent. And we've just started.
Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which -- and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation. Those regulations are unleashing our economy. So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent.
Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent? We're already at 2.6. Maybe I'll have to increase my offer. And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council? When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.
Not all of them, but some of them did. But I remember the ones that did. But they'll say, We take -- oh, we'll take -- but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass -- Don, can we get together for lunch? Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.
These people just don't get it. They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately? They like it better. Why should they be on a council? You know, that's the way it is, folks.
That's the way it is. To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years. Now, we need the help of Congress, please.
OK? We need the help of Congress. And we really could use some Democrat help. We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.
The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct. If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut. Just remember that, OK? America's crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound.
We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country. That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America. We want more products stamped with the letters, ""Made in the U.S.A."".
We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money. So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side. Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.
You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52. So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy. It's time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families.
We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again. We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We're going to do an infrastructure bill.
We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future.
American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently. And American workers will bring this future to life.
We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism. We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything. It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.
Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny. We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.
We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is our moment.
This is our chance. This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America. Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.
So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Arizona.
God bless you. Thank you. Thank you."
2017-08-21,Speech: Donald Trump Delivers Primetime Speech on Afghanistan,"Fort Myer, VA, United States","[-77.0810889, 38.883541]",donald-trump-speech-afghanistan-fort-myer-virginia-august-21-2017,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Please be seated. Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan and Colonel Duggan. Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad.
We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea as well as to those conducting the search and recovery efforts.
I am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the service members here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.
Since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history.
American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield -- for our nation and for our freedom. Through their lives, and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.
By following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal and to remain one nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission and one shared sense of purpose.
They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed and color to serve together and sacrifice together in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all service members are brothers and sisters. They are all part of the same family. It's called the American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag and live according to the same law.
They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other. The soldier understands what we as a nation too often forget, that a wound inflicted upon on a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt.
And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together. Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people. When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate.
The young men and women we sent to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.
As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas, and we will always win, let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.
Thanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military, and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11, and nobody can ever forget that, have not been repeated on our shores. But we must acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight, that nearly 16 years after September 11 attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory.
Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history -- 17 years. I share the American people's frustration. I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly, lives trying to rebuild countries in our own image instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.
That is why shortly after my inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia.
My original instinct was to pull out, and historically I like following my instincts. But all my life, I have heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the oval office. In other words, when you are president of the United States.
So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David with my cabinet and generals to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusion about America's core interests in Afghanistan.
First, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need and the trust they have earned to fight and to win.
Second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11. And as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq.
As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorists enemies. Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for bled to liberate and won were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS. The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.
Third and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.
For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states, whose tense relations threat to spiral into conflict, and that could happen.
No one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions.
When I became president, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into. Big and intricate problems. But one way or another, these problems will be solved. I am a problem solver. And in the end, we will win. We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now, the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today, an extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal
We need look no further than last week's vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children.
You saw it for yourself. Horrible. As I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia, three months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology.
Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs and criminals and predators, and, that's right, losers. Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America's interests are clear.
We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America. And we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us or anywhere in the world, for that matter. But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history.
As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways: A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions.
I've said it many times, how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin or end military operations.
We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. Conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on. America's enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out.
I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will. Another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power, diplomatic, economic, and military, toward a successful outcome.
Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban and Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. America will continue its support for the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field.
Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace. We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation building again. We are killing terrorists.
The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach in how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.
Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists. In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies.
The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices, but Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time they are housing the same terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change. And that will change immediately
No partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.
Another critical part of the South Asia strategy or America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India, the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic harbor of the United States.
We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work and work effectively and work quickly. I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our war fighters that prevented the secretary of defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy.
Micromanagement from Washington, D.C., does not win battles. They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers, acting in real time with real authority and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy. That is why we will also expand authority for American armed forces to target the terrorists and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan.
The killers need to know they have nowhere to hide, that no place is beyond the reach of American might and American arms. Retribution will be fast and powerful. As we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq.
Since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.
Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition. â attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.
We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will.
Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so. In this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces.
As the prime minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us. Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us.
The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. We want them to succeed. But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests.
We are not asking others to change their way of life but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward. Military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country.
But strategically-applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace. America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress.
However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results.
Our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open. In abiding by the oath I took on January 20, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests. In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat.
Terrorists, take heed. America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. In every generation we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed.
We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for. Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America's greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington national cemetery. There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of this Earth.
Many of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11, 2001. They volunteered for a simple reason: they loved America and they were determined to protect her. Now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives.
We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad. We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.
Our actions and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation.
With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace. We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls and everlasting pride in each and every one of you. Thank you. May God bless our military, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you."

This week, the Dow Jones Industrial average reached an all-time high. Never ever has it been so high. In May, the unemployment rate hit a 16-year low. And last quarter, real GDP growth increased to 2.6%.
Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we're putting American workers and families first. The American dream has always been about doing what we love, and doing it for the people we love
Whether serving in the armed forces, manufacturing goods, or starting a small business, our citizens pursue their aspirations and improve the lives of millions in countless, countless ways. Yet, for too long, the dreams of many Americans have been put out of reach by Washington. Washington funded one global project after another while allowing other countries to drain our jobs, and drain the wealth of the United States of America.
Then, Washington taxed and regulated our own workers and industries, taking away their ability to earn a living. But those days are over. My administration is working tirelessly on behalf of the American people. We have removed regulations, and targeted unfair trade practices that are hurting Americans all over the world.
We're ending the war on coal, and unleashing American energy. We are introducing a tax plan to grow our economy and create more jobs. Factories and plants are coming back into Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and many other states. They are coming back instead of leaving like they have been for decades.
And just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based green card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country. You can't just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades you come in, immediately start picking up welfare.
For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems. As I said in my address to Congress, the time for dreaming big, bold, and daring things for our country has begun. When Americans are free to pursue their dreams, there is no limit to what we can achieve.
This is truly an exciting time in our country. Every day, we're accomplishing great things for our people. Thank you, God bless you, God bless the United States. We're really moving along, we're bringing back our jobs, we're making America great again. Thank you."

Thank you. I am thrilled to be back in the very, very beautiful state of West Virginia. And I am proud to stand before you and celebrate the hard working people who are the absolute backbone of America. Thank you. I love the people of the states. I love your grit, your spirit, and I love our coal miners. They are coming back strong. [Applause]
I made you a promise during the campaign. You all remember. Many of you were here. I actually think we have more people here tonight with thousands outside than we had during the campaign, if you can believe it. [Applause]
And as you've seen, I've kept that promise. As President, we are putting our coal miners back to work. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We've stopped the EPA intrusion. American coal exports are already up.
Think of this. Think of this. American exports of coal are already up more than 60% this year. Did you ever hear of anything like that? What you voted for is happening every single day. Everyone in the arena is united by shared values. [Applause]
We believe in God, we believe this team, we believe in country. We support the Constitution of the United States of America. We cherish and defend the second amendment. We believe school should teach students to love our country, to have pride in our history, and to respect our great American flag. We stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you.
We believe strongly that a nation must defend and protect its borders. And above all else, we believe we must take care of our own citizens, and put America first. Day after day, we are keeping the promises that we made during the campaign.
That includes our promises to our great veterans. Thank you, veteran... veterans. Today we announce new telehealth services to help the veterans get the care when and where they need it. It is so popular. This state has many retired military members. We thank them. We thank their family and spouses for their patriotic service. They have been incredible.
We in America honor our great heros. This week in the East Room of the White House, I awarded the Medal of Honor to a true American hero. Specialist 5, James C. McCloughan. Many of you watched as I gave Jim the medal.
He courageously saved the lives of his fellow soldiers in Vietnam. His story is now enshrined forever. Earlier this morning the former Marine named Woody Williams lead everyone here in the Pledge of Allegiance. Thank you, Woody. [Applause, Crowd chants USA]
Woody received a Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman for his actions in Iwo Jima. We honor you and salute you and thank you for what you've done for all of us. Thank you, Woody. We must protect them with their put, sweat, tears, and bravery.
All across the country Americans of every kind are coming together with one simple goal. Make America great again. The stock market reached yet another all time in history. All time high today. Boosting at the retirement savings, hope any, of everybody in the room. Have you all been helped? I think so. Unemployment is at a 16-year low don't forget.
I'll never forget the millions and millions of people out there that want jobs that don't register on the unemployment rolls, because they gave up looking for jobs. So I accept the number, but honestly, we all know there are millions of people out there that we love.
The forgotten men and women and they are looking for jobs. They are going to have them. I have factories coming back into the country. You've seen that. They are coming back. [Cheers]
We have auto plants expanding and coming back they are coming into Michigan. They are really coming into Michigan. And they are coming into Ohio and Pennsylvania. Economic growth has surged to 2.6% nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. And at 3% growth in West Virginia. I wonder how that happened. 3% growth. West Virginia, you are leading the average.
When was the last time you heard that, West Virginia? You are leading the country's average. Remember I told you don't sell your homes. Don't sell your homes. You are doing great. I'm so proud of you.
You know, we won the state by 42 points. Can you believe that? 42 points. I asked your Republican party leader how would we be doing today versus November 8th and Election Day. He said honestly, President Trump, you are doing better. I said better? 42 points since our election, not mine, since our election we've added more than one million new jobs.
And the good news keeping on pouring in. In fact, we have a very important announcement to make tonight. Does anybody know what that announcement is? Does anybody know what that announcement is? We have a very, very large announcement. Do you understand? Large. So I would like to invite my good friend and your Governor, Jim Justice, up to the stage to share this news with all of you. Jim, come on up.
Come on up, Jim. Look at this guy. Jim is going to say a few words. These words have not been spoken by a major political figure, meaning Governor or Senator in our country for a long time. Thank you.
First of all, it is a real honor. Thank you for coming. Thank our great President for being here. I've got to tell you a couple of stories real quick. I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last few weeks. I've been to present an idea on coal and manufacturing. I've had the great opportunity to be with our President.
Let me tell you just this. I have to be serious with you just a moment. I have to tell you at the last session of our legislature I tried with all of my soul. Now I can tell you if you'll just give me just a moment. This man and myself are are not politicians. We ran to get something done. We ran and gave up part of our lives. We ran, because we want nothing.
We ran as our founding fathers did years and years ago to serve now I will promise you until my soul that no one loves West Virginia more than I. In the last session, I would tell you that there was something greatness to passed with our rows and so on. But there was way too much pain. Now listen to me and listen really good. We hurt a lot of people.
We hurt our vets and our teachers and our disabled and our weak and we walked away from at the old. Now I can promise you just this, I came -- I came to only get something done. Let me just say this to you as bluntly as I can say it. West Virginia, at the altar when we had it done, like it or not like it, but the Democrats walked away from me.
Now today I would tell you with los of prayers and lots of thinking, today I'll tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you being a Democrat Governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican. Applause, Cheers]
As a coach, I would tell you it is time to run another play. I would also tell you this, please pay close attention to this. My mom and dad were staunch lovers of Ronald Reagan. Staunch Republicans.
My mom and dad are no question in my mind in heaven right now and their both saying the same thing. But my mom is saying it more profoundly. That is she's saying, Jimmy, it's about damn time you came to your senses. Now let let me go one step further and say just this. What in the world is wrong us as people? Have we not heard enough about the Russians? I mean to our God in heaven above.
The stock market is in 22,000. And this country has hope. We're on our way. This man is the really dear friend of mine. But you know what else is unbelievable? This man now has a Chief of Staff that all of us can pronounce his first name. And you know what that name is today? It is ""Sir"". Think about that.
Now I'll end by saying we're a long ways from being perfect. There's mistakes made and change is tough. I can tell you this tough. I can tell you this: This man is a reflection of his kids. Eric Trump has been in the back of the woods changing a tire, I've talked with Donald Junior, and Ivanka and Jared, -- even though Jared is our great son-in-law, are so good at being in charge.
Now I'll end by saying very quickly this man is a good man. He's got -- he's got a backbone, he's got real ideas. We cares about America, he cares about us in West Virginia. And most importantly of all, you know what? He has made us as common, every everyday Americans, feel good and be proud of who we are. My friend, our great President, Donald J. Trump. [Applause]
I want to thank your great Governor. Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor. I will tell you. Such an honor. It is a fantastic man. A fantastic guy. And thank you, Jim, very much all over the nation. They are watching. They really appreciate that.
And we have another friend with us tonight who voted for us on health care and honestly, how the Republicans and the Democrats let us down on that is hard to believe. Repeal and replace. Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Senators. A Senator who voted for us, Shelley Moore, who is here with us tonight. Thank you, Shelley.
Jim came to the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago. We talked about how we are working together to open up the coal mines in this state and also very importantly to create jobs in furniture manufacturing, and other forms of manufacturing very important to Jim.
But Governor Justice did something else very important tonight. He showed the country that our agenda rises above left or right it is an agenda for all of the people, especially for the tens of millions of forgotten Americans. They are not so forgotten anymore. I will tell you.
He approved that. You proved it. They are not forgotten anymore. Countless citizens, Democrats, and Republicans, independents, have been neglected and ignored by Washington. But we will make sure they are never ignored again.
We know there are powerful forces in Washington who want to stomp us. But we won't let them. We are fighting for every American who has been overlooked, pushed aside, or told to put their dreams on hold but we will win and we're winning though. The failed voices in Washington who oppose our movement are the exact same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another.
Who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another, and who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. They gave them away. We don't need advice from the Washington swamp. We need to drain the swamp. [Applause]
Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves. You know it better than most. I didn't come to Washington for me. I came to Washington for all of you. That I can tell you. [Applause]
Your dreams are my dreams. Your hopes are my hopes. And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. The question for Democrats -- all Democrats, including those in Congress, is whether they are on the side of the voters or are they on the side of the special interests? The reason why Democrats only talk about at the totally made up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision.
They don't talk about the all time high stock market. They don't talk about reforms to the V.A. Or about manufacturing jobs we're bringing back to America by the hundreds of thousands. They don't talk about the Keystone pipeline that I immediately approved or the Dakota Access Pipeline. Russia story is a total fabrication.
It is just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics. That's all it is. It is just makes them feel better what they have nothing else to talk about.
What the prosecutor should be look at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted e-mails, and they should be looking at the paid Russian speeches. And the owned Russian companies. Or let them look at at the uranium she sold that's now in the hands of very angry Russian.
Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were. We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you. That I can tell you. We won because we totally out worked the other side. We won because millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country.
Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians? They can't beat us at the voting booths. They are trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. They are trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.
I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one. Which is what at the the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve. And what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve Democrat lawmakers will have to decide.
They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax, or they can serve the interests of the American people. Try winning a the voter booth. Try winning at the voter booth.
Not going to be easy. But that's the way you are supposed to do it. Our agenda is the pro-growth agenda. We want to control our boarders and lift our people from welfare to work. We want to support our police and make our communities safe. We want to reduce taxes and increase wages for all of our people.
We want to get the special interest out of politics for good. And we want to bring back our plants and our factories and our manufacturing and that's what is happening right now. You see it, and so does every other state in our union.
That is why in the proud tradition of America's great leaders from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt, we are protecting American workers and we are protecting American industry for the first time in many, many decades. No longer will we allow other considerations to close our jobs, steal our factories, and drain our wealth. We are building our future with American labor and hands and aluminum and steel and, what else, coal.
We will buy American and we will hire American. To protect our jobs and our industry, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership. And to protect our workers and coal miners, I also withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
But not only are we bringing back our jobs, we are bringing back our safety. We have seen the bloodshed and devastation inflicted by terrorists in America, in Europe, and all across the world I said it during the campaign. I will say it again right here tonight.
We will keep radical, Islamic terrorists out of our country. [Applause, Crowd chants USA] we only want to admit people in our country who love our people and who share our values. We're also keeping our country safe from criminal gangs and violent crime.
We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers. Human traffickers. And the vile criminal cartels like MS-13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count.
Just last week I visited Long Island. MS-13 has brought violence to a once-peaceful and beautiful neighborhood right where I grew up. We are liberating American communities from the vicious, violent gangs.
One by one we're finding the drug dealers, gang members, thieves, criminals, and predators, and we're throwing them out of our country. Once they are gone, we will not let them back in. We are stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.
You have a big problem in West Virginia and we are going to solve that problem. We are cracking down strongly on sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens. And in order to stop the drugs, gangs, and traffickers, we are building a wall on the southern border.
I also proudly announced legislation this week with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue to perform our immigration system to protect American workers and American taxpayers. It is called the raise act. R-A-I-S-E. The Raise Act.
For many years America has issued most of the green cards to lower-skilled immigrants. And people who had no hope of getting a job. Undermining blue collar workers and wages and costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year. The Raise Act switches to a merit-based system. You come in largely based on merit.
Doesn't that sound nice? Wouldn't that be nice? It is about time. Our proposal prevents new immigrants from going on welfare for at least five years. So you don't come in and go on welfare.
Our plan favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and who demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country. We believe decisions on who immigrants are in our country should be based on the best interest of America and the best interest of the American people. You.
We are working to honor millions and million of workers who came out and voted for us. That's why I will repeat again tonight that Congress must do its job, keep its promise, live up to its were, and repeal and replace Obamacare. You have to do it.
Fog in life is easy. But Congress must not give in. They must not give up. But instead, Congress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they've been talking about for seven years. Incredible. One vote.
Incredible. But we'll get it. We'll get it, folks. They can't give up. Call your Congressman, call your Senators, call everybody. Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. Which is a disaster.
To be a prosperous nation, it is critical we lower the tax burden on our workers and businesses. The United States has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world.
We want to bring it down to one of the lowest, because we want more growth, more jobs, and high er pay. That's what's doing to happen. And importantly, we also want to let Americans keep more of their own money.
Not take it from them. It is time to pass a tax cut for middle class families. Finally, and you'll see very soon what you are hearing about it, my administration is committed to rebuilding the deleted infrastructure of the United States.
Think of it. We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East and the Middle East is a hundred times worse than it was 16 years ago when we started. Can you believe this? What a shame.
That's why we are pushing a $1 trillion new infrastructure investment bill. We're going to fix our roads, we're going to fix our bridges, we're going to fix our highways and our schools and our airports we will create amazing monuments that inspire awe and wonder in our people. It used to be that way.
It is not that way any longer. We have airports that look like third world countries. It is not going to be that way anymore. American workers will build this great future. And American energy and American clean coal will power this future. We are the nation that put a man on the moon that dug out the Panama Canal, and that won two world wars.
We can do anything, we can build anything with and we can dream anything. We share one home and one glorious destination. Where we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood.
We all salute that same great American flag. And we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as we remember these truths and who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never fail.
America will triumph. Freedom will prevail. Our values will endure. Our citizens will prosper. And our nation will thrive as never before. With patriotism in our soul and with love for West Virginia in our hearts, we say these words again tonight.
We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again we will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, West Virginia. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-07-28,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-july-28-2017,"My fellow Americans. This past week, we have celebrated, saluted, and honored American heroes who have devoted their lives to God, family, and country. Aboard USS Gerald R. Ford, we saluted those who will defend our flag on the newest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our world.
In Ohio, I delivered a very special award to a heroic military survivor from the Pearl Harbor attack. Long ago, but he's still in great shape. At the White House, we have bestowed the Medal of Valor on the brave police officers who saved so many lives after a gunman opened fire on lawmakers during a congressional baseball practice. They were very, very brave, and they truly did save lives.
And today, in New York, we thank the law enforcement officers who are going after violent criminals and MS-13 gang members, and restoring safety and peace to our communities.
All American heroes, whether they patrol the oceans, protect our capitol, safeguard our streets, or serve in many other ways, share a common bond. They believe in America; they live our citizens, and they will stop at nothing to defend our safety and our freedom.
That is why we honor our heroes and work hard every day to build an America that is worthy of their sacrifice The source of America's strength is found in the spirit of our people. The heroes among us represent that American spirit, courage, love, and sacrifice.
Our hearts are filled with pride and gratitude for all of those who, for over two centuries, have secured our nation and protected our citizens. Throughout our history, heroes have answered the call of duty to defend our country in its hour of need, and they're always there for us. And, frankly, one of the great privileges and joys of serving as President of the United States is getting to spend time with these incredible Americans.
Our heroes show us who we are as a nation and a people. They remind us that every citizen is capable of greatness, and they renew the promise that America will grow stronger and greater than ever before. And that's what we're doing right now. Look at all the jobs that are coming in. Look at what's happening with the stock markets, look at so many things where we're just getting bigger, better, and stronger, and never ever forget our military, where we're adding billions and billions of dollars of new planes, new ships, and new equipment for our great soldiers and military personnel.
After all, heroes are made in America, and we have to take care of our heroes. Thank you and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
2017-07-28,Remarks: Donald Trump Gives Remarks on MS-13 to Law Enforcement,"Ronkonkoma, NY, United States","[-73.1241488, 40.80641869999999]",donald-trump-speech-ms13-law-enforcement-july-28-2017,"Well, thank you very much. This is certainly being home for me. I spent a lot of time right here. I was in Queens, so I'd come here, and this was like the luxury location for me. And I love it. I love the people here. Even coming in from the airport, I sat with Nikki Haley, who's here someplace. Where's our Nikki?
Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is so incredible. [Applause] And she's seen crowds in her life, and she said, boy, those are really big crowds. Crowds of people all lining the streets, all the way over to here. And it's really a special place. And so when I heard about this, I said, I want to do that one.
But I really wanted to do it not because of location, but because, as you know, I am the big, big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement, okay? From day one. [Applause] From day one. We love our police. We love our sheriffs. And we love our ICE officers. And they have been working hard. [Applause] Thank you. They have been working hard.
Together, we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities, and we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, MS-13, and many other gangs. But MS-13 is particularly violent.
They don't like shooting people because it's too quick, it's too fast. I was reading -- one of these animals was caught -- in explaining, they like to knife them and cut them, and let them die slowly because that way it's more painful, and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals.
We're joined today by police and sheriffs from Suffolk, Nassau, Dutchess and Ulster counties; state police from New York and New Jersey -- many of you I know, great friends; Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; and law enforcement personnel from a number of federal agencies. So we're loaded up with great people -- that's what I call it.
And I want to just tell you all together, right now, the reason I came -- this is the most important sentence to me: On behalf of the American people, I want to say, thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you.
And I don't think you know how much the public respects and admires you. You're saving American lives every day, and we have your backs -- believe me -- we have your backs 100 percent. Not like the old days. Not like the old days. [Applause]
You know, when you wanted to take over and you used military equipment -- and they were saying you couldn't do it -- you know what I said? That was my first day: You can do it. [Laughter] In fact, that stuff is disappearing so fast we have none left. [Laughter] You guys know -- you really knew how to get that. But that's my honor. And I tell you what -- it's being put to good use.
I especially want to thank ICE Director Tom Homan, who has done an incredible job in just a short period of time. Tom, get up here. I know you just -- [Applause] -- Tom is determined to rid our nation of cartels and criminals who are preying on our citizens. And I can only say to Tom: Keep up the great work. He's a tough guy. He's a tough cookie. Somebody said the other day, they saw him on television, and somebody -- they were interviewed after that; they said, he looks very nasty, he looks very mean. I said, that's what I'm looking for. [Laughter] That's exactly what I was looking for.
And for that, I want to congratulate John Kelly, who has done an incredible job of Secretary of Homeland Security. Incredible. [Applause] One of our real stars. Truly, one of our stars. John Kelly is one of our great stars. You know, the border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn't go down -- it went up.
But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent. And, in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor -- believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they're not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General Kelly.
Let me also express our gratitude to the members of the New York Delegation here today: Congressman Chris Collins. Where's Chris? Oh, Chris, right from the beginning he said, ""Trump is going to win. Trump is going to win."" So I like him. [Laughter] I didn't like him that much before; now I love him. [Applause, Laughter] Dan Donovan -- thanks, Dan. [Applause] Thank you, Dan. And Lee Zeldin, who I supported right from the beginning, when they said he didn't have a chance of beating a pretty popular incumbent. [Applause]
And I saw him in a debate. I said, I think this guy is going to win. But he fought a pretty popular guy, and I said, I think he's going to win and went heavy for him, and he won. And he won pretty easily, didn't you? Pretty good. I'm proud of you. Great job.
And, of course, a legend, somebody that we all know very well, sort of my neighbor -- because I consider him a neighbor -- but he's really a great and highly respected man in Washington, Congressman Peter King. [Applause] Very respected guy. He is a respected man that people like to ask opinions of. I do.
Congressman King and his colleagues know the terrible pain and violence MS-13 has inflicted upon this community -- and this country. And if you remember just a little more than two years ago, when I came down the escalator with Melania, and I made the speech -- people coming into this country. Everyone said, what does he know? What's he talking about?
And there was bedlam. Remember bedlam? And then about two months later, they said, you know, he's right. So I'm honored to have brought it to everybody's attention. But the suffering and the pain that we were going through -- and now you can look at the numbers -- it's a whole different world.
And it will get better and better and better because we've been able to start nipping it in the bud. We've nipped it in the bud -- let's call it start nipping in the bud.
And MS-13, the cartel, has spread gruesome bloodshed throughout the United States. We've gotten a lot of them out of here. Big, big percentage. But the rest are coming -- they'll be out of here quickly, right? Quickly. Good. [Applause]
So I asked Tom on the plane -- he was never on Air Force One -- I said, how do you like it? He said, I like it. [Laughter] But I said, hey, Tom, let me ask you a question -- how tough are these guys, MS-13? He said, they're nothing compared to my guys. Nothing. And that's what you need. Sometimes that's what you need, right?
For many years, they exploited America's weak borders and lax immigration enforcement to bring drugs and violence to cities and towns all across America. They're there right now because of weak political leadership, weak leadership, weak policing, and in many cases because the police weren't allowed to do their job.
I've met police that are great police that aren't allowed to do their job because they have a pathetic mayor or a mayor doesn't know what's going on. [Applause]
Were you applauding for someone in particular? [Laughter] It's sad. It's sad. You look at what's happening, it's sad. But hopefully -- certainly in the country, those days are over. You may have a little bit longer to wait.
But from now on, we're going to enforce our laws, protect our borders, and support our police like our police have never been supported before. We're going to support you like you've never been supported before. [Applause]
Few communities have suffered worse at the hands of these MS-13 thugs than the people of Long Island. Hard to believe. I grew up on Long Island. I didn't know about this. I didn't know about this. And then all of a sudden, this is like a new phenomenon. Our hearts and our nation grieve for the victims and their families.
Since January '16 -- think of this -- MS-13 gang members have brutally murdered 17 beautiful, young lives in this area on Long Island alone. Think of it. They butcher those little girls. They kidnap, they extort, they rape and they rob. They prey on children. They shouldn't be here. They stomp on their victims. They beat them with clubs. They slash them with machetes, and they stab them with knives. They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields. They're animals.
We cannot tolerate as a society the spilling of innocent, young, wonderful, vibrant people -- sons and daughters, even husbands and wives. We cannot accept this violence one day more. Can't do it, and we're not going to do it. Because of you, we're not going to be able to do it. You're not going to allow it to happen, and we're backing you up 100 percent. Remember that -- 100 percent. [Applause]
It is the policy of this administration to dismantle, decimate and eradicate MS-13 at every other -- and I have to say, MS-13, that's a name; rough groups -- that's fine. We got a lot of others. And they were all let in here over a relatively short period of time. Not during my period of time, believe me. But we're getting them out. They're going to jails, and then they're going back to their country. Or they're going back to their country, period.
One by one, we're liberating our American towns. Can you believe that I'm saying that? I'm talking about liberating our towns. This is like I'd see in a movie: They're liberating the town, like in the old Wild West, right? We're liberating our towns. I never thought I'd be standing up here talking about liberating the towns on Long Island where I grew up, but that's what you're doing.
And I can tell you, I saw some photos where Tom's guys -- rough guys. They're rough. I don't want to be -- say it because they'll say that's not politically correct. You're not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work. We have to get -- just like they don't want to have rich people at the head of Treasury, okay? [Laughter] Like, I want a rich guy at the head of Treasury, right? Right? [Applause]
I want a rich guy at the head of Commerce. Because we've been screwed so badly on trade deals, I want people that made a lot of money now to make a lot of money for our country.
And, by the way, as I was walking up, they just gave me the numbers. Our numbers just came out this morning. GDP is up double from what it was in the first quarter. [Applause] 2.6 percent. We're doing well. We're doing really well.
And we took off all those restrictions. And some we're statutorily stuck with a for a little while, but eventually that statute comes up, and we're going to be able to cut a lot more. But we've sort of liberated the world of creating jobs like you're liberating us and the people that live in areas.
But I have to say, one by one, we are indeed freeing up these great American towns and cities that are under siege from gang violence. Look at Los Angeles. Look at what's going on in Los Angeles. Look at Chicago. What is going on? Is anybody here from Chicago? We have to send some of you to Chicago, I think. [Laughter] What's going on?
I mean, you see what's happening there? There's no -- do we agree? Is there something maybe -- [Applause] -- is there something -- I have to tell you one Chicago story. So Chicago is having this unbelievable violence; people being killed -- four, five, six in a weekend. And I'm saying, what is going on?
And when I was running, we had motorcycle brigades take us to the planes and stuff. And one of the guys, really good -- you could see a really respected officer, police officer. He was at the head. He was the boss. And you could see he was the boss. He actually talked like the boss. ""Come on, get lined up."" Because I'd always take pictures with the police because I did that. My guys said, don't do it. Don't do it. [Applause]
Other candidates didn't do it that I was beating by 40 points, can you believe it? But I did it. Maybe that's why I was winning by 40 points. But other candidates wouldn't do it, but I always took the pictures with the police.
But we're in Chicago, and we had massive motorcycle bridges, and you know those people have to volunteer. I don't know if you know that, but from what I understand, they have to volunteer. And I had the biggest brigades. I had brigades sometimes with almost 300 motorcycles. Even I was impressed. I'd look ahead and it was nothing but motorcycles because they'd volunteer from all over various states.
But this one guy was impressive. He was a rough cookie and really respected guy. I could see he was respected. And he said, ""All right, come on, get over here. Get over here. He's got to get to work. Get over here."" And I said, ""So let me tell -- you're from Chicago?"" ""Yes, sir."" I said, ""What the hell is going on?""
And he said, ""It's a problem; it can be straightened out."" I said, ""How long would it take you to straighten out this problem?"" He said, ""If you gave me the authority, a couple of days."" [Laughter] I really mean it. I said, ""You really think so?"" He said, ""A couple of days. We know all the bad ones. We know them all."" And he said, the officers -- you guys, you know all the bad ones in your area. You know them by their names. He said, ""We know them all. A couple of days.""
I said, ""You got to be kidding."" Now, this is a year and a half ago. I said, ""Give me your card."" And he gave me a card. And I sent it to the mayor. I said, ""You ought to try using this guy."" [Laughter] Guess what happened? Never heard. And last week they had another record. It's horrible.
But we're just getting started. We will restore law and order on Long Island. We'll bring back justice to the United States. I'm very happy to have gotten a great, great Justice of the United States Supreme Court, not only nominated, but approved. And, by the way, your Second Amendment is safe. [Applause] Your Second Amendment is safe. I feel very good about that. It wasn't looking so good for the Second Amendment, was it, huh? If Trump doesn't win, your Second Amendment is gone. Your Second Amendment would be gone.
But I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien that are threatening so violently our people: We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you. [Applause]
And, you know, we had some problems with certain countries. Still do with a couple, but we'll take care of them -- don't worry about it. Anytime we have a trade deficit, it's very easy -- which is almost everywhere. We have trade deficits with almost every country because we had a lot of really bad negotiators making deals with other countries. So it's almost everywhere, so that takes care of itself.
But we had certain countries in South America where they wouldn't take the people back. And I said, that's okay, no more trade. All of a sudden they started taking their people back. It's amazing, isn't it? They used to send to the former Secretary of State of the country, ""Please call. Would you please work it so that we can take"" -- and they used to just tell her, ""No, we won't take back.""
They take back with us, every single time. We're having very little problem. Are we having any problem right now with that? Huh? You better believe it. Give me the names of the few problems. We'll take care of it, I'm telling you. [Applause, Laughter] It's unbelievable.
One of the old people -- one of the people that represented the other administration -- I said, why didn't you use that, the power of economics? ""Sir, we think one thing has nothing to do with another."" I said, oh, really? So we'll have big deficits and they won't take back these criminals that came from there and should be back there? Well, believe me, to me, everything matters. But they're all taking them back.
ICE officers recently conducted the largest crackdown on criminal gangs in the history of our country. In just six weeks, ICE and our law enforcement partners arrested nearly 1,400 suspects and seized more than 200 illegal firearms and some beauties, and nearly 600 pounds of narcotics.
The men and women of ICE are turning the tide in the battle against MS-13. But we need more resources from Congress -- and we're getting them. Congress is actually opening up and really doing a job. They should have approved healthcare last night, but you can't have everything. Boy, oh, boy. They've been working on that one for seven years. Can you believe that? The swamp. But we'll get it done. We're going to get it done.
You know, I said from the beginning: Let Obamacare implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode. [Applause] Right now, we have less than 6,000 Enforcement and Removal Officers in ICE.
This is not enough to protect a nation of more than 320 million people. It's essential that Congress fund another 10,000 ICE officers -- and we're asking for that -- so that we can eliminate MS-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country.
Now, we're getting them out anyway, but we'd like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon -- you just see them thrown in, rough -- I said, please don't be too nice. [Laughter]
Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? Like, don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody -- don't hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, okay? [Applause, Laughter]
It's essential that Congress fund hundreds more federal immigration judges and prosecutors -- and we need them quickly, quickly -- if we're going to dismantle these deadly networks. And I have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years they've been made to protect the criminal. Totally made to protect the criminal, not the officers.Donald Trump
We're also working with Chairman Bob Goodlatte on a series of enforcement measures -- and he's a terrific guy -- to keep our country safe from crime and terrorism -- and in particular, radical Islamic terrorism. [Applause] A term never uttered by the past administration. Never uttered. Did anybody ever hear that term? I don't think so. But you heard it from me.
That includes cracking down on sanctuary cities that defy federal law, shield visa overstays, and that release dangerous criminals back into the United States' communities. That's what's happening. They're releasing them. So many deaths where they release somebody back into the community, and they know it's going to end that way. That's the sad -- they know it's going to end that way. We're ending those procedures. [Applause] Thank you.
We have to secure -- I spoke to parents, incredible parents. I got to know so many parents of children that were so horribly killed -- burned to death, beaten to death, just the worst kind of death you can ever -- stuffed in barrels. And the person that did it was released, and you'd look at the file, and there were letter after letter after letter of people begging not to let this animal back into society; that this would happen, it would happen quickly.
It wasn't even like it would happen over a long period of time. They were saying it would happen quickly. It's total violence. He's a totally violent person. You cannot let this person out.
They let the person out, and sometimes it would happen like on the first day. And then you have to talk to the parents and hold the parents and hug them. And they're crying so -- I mean crying. Their lives are destroyed. And nobody thinks about those people. They don't think about those people. They're devastated.
But we're ending so much of that. We're ending hopefully all of that. The laws are tough. The laws are stacked against us, but we're ending that. [Applause] So we're going to secure our borders against illegal entry, and we will build the wall. That I can tell you. [Applause]
In fact, last night -- you don't read about this too much, but it was approved -- $1.6 billion for the phase one of the wall, which is not only design but the start of construction over a period of about two years, but the start of construction for a great border wall. And we're going to build it. The Wall is a vital, and vital as a tool, for ending the humanitarian disaster brought -- and really brought on by drug smugglers and new words that we haven't heard too much of -- human traffickers.
This is a term that's been going on from the beginning of time, and they say it's worse now than it ever was. You go back a thousand years where you think of human trafficking, you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years. Human trafficking they say -- think of it, but they do -- human trafficking is worse now maybe than it's ever been in the history of this world.
We need a wall. We also need it, though, for the drugs, because the drugs aren't going through walls very easily -- especially the walls that I build. I'm a very good builder. You people know that better than most because you live in the area. That's why I'm here. [Applause] We'll build a good wall.
Now, we're going to build a real wall. We're going to build a wall that works, and it's going to have a huge impact on the inflow of drugs coming across. The wall is almost -- that could be one of the main reasons you have to have it. It's an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country.
The previous administration enacted an open-door policy to illegal migrants from Central America. ""Welcome in. Come in, please, please."" As a result, MS-13 surged into the country and scoured, and just absolutely destroyed, so much in front of it. New arrivals came in and they were all made recruits of each other, and they fought with each other, and then they fought outside of each other. And it got worse and worse, and we've turned that back.
In the three years before I took office, more than 150,000 unaccompanied alien minors arrived at the border and were released all throughout our country into United States' communities -- at a tremendous monetary cost to local taxpayers and also a great cost to life and safety.
Nearly 4,000 from this wave were released into Suffolk County -- congratulations -- including seven who are now indicted for murder. You know about that. In Washington, D.C. region, at least 42 alien minors from the border surge have been recently implicated in MS-13-related violence, including 19 charged in killings or attempted killings.
You say, what happened to the old days where people came into this country, they worked and they worked and they worked, and they had families, and they paid taxes, and they did all sorts of things, and their families got stronger, and they were closely knit? We don't see that. Failure to enforce our immigration laws had predictable results: drugs, gangs and violence. But that's all changing now.
Under the Trump administration, America is once more a nation of laws and once again a nation that stands up for our law enforcement officers. [Applause] We will defend our country, protect our communities, and put the safety of the American people first. And I'm doing that with law enforcement, and we're doing that with trade, and we're doing that with so much else. It's called America First. It's called an expression I'm sure you've never heard of: Make America Great Again. Has anybody heard that expression? [Applause]
That is my promise to each of you. That is the oath I took as President, and that is my sacred pledge to the American people. Thank you everyone here today. You are really special, special Americans. And thank you in particular to the great police, sheriffs, and ICE officers. You do a spectacular job. The country loves you. The country respects you.
You don't hear it, but believe me, they respect you as much as they respect anything. There is the respect about our country. You are spectacular people. [Applause, Audience chants USA]
Because of the danger of your job, which people also understand fully, I leave you with the following: Thank you and may God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. [Applause]"
2017-07-25,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Youngstown, Ohio","Youngstown, OH, United States","[-80.6495194, 41.0997803]",donald-trump-speech-rally-youngstown-ohio-july-25-2017,"Thank you, Melania, America loves our First Lady, thank you. I am thrilled to be back in the great state of Ohio right here with the incredible men and women of Youngstown. What an amazing few days it's been. On Saturday, I was in Virginia with thousands of brave men and women of the United States military.
Do we love the United States military? We commissioned the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our nation, the USS Gerald R. Ford into the great American fleet. [Applause] Then yesterday, I was in West Virginia with almost 50,000 of our most impressive young Americans.
They are young men who learned to cherish words like duty, honor, God, and country, the Boy Scouts. Then only a few hours ago the senate approved a vote to begin debating the repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. [Applause, Cheers] Finally. You think that's easy? That's not easy.
We're now one step closer to liberating our citizens from this Obamacare nightmare, and delivering great health care for the American people. We're gonna do that too. And now tonight I'm back in the center of the American heartland, far away from the Washington swamp to spend time with thousands of true American patriots. [Audience chants Drain the Swamp] We have spent the entire week celebrating with the hard-working men and women who are helping us make America great again.
I'm here this evening to cut through the fake news filter and to speak straight to the American people. fake news. fake, fake, fake news..
Boy oh boy, people. Is there any place that's more fun, more exciting and safer than a Trump rally?
Where the hell did he come from? This has been a difficult week for the media because I forced them to travel with us all around the country and spend time with tens of thousands of proud Americans who believe in defending our values, our culture, our borders, our civilization, and our great American way of life. [Applause], Everyone in this arena is united by their love, and you know that. Do we know that. Everyone.
United by their love for this country and their loyalty to one another, their loyalty to its people. [Applause] And we want people to come into our country who can love us and cherish us and be proud of America and the American flag. [Applause] We believe that schools should teach our children to have pride in our history and respect for that great American flag. We all believe in the rule of law, and we support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
Thank you. Thank you for being here. [cheers. We celebrate our military and believe the American armed forces are the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world, and by the way, they're getting a lot greater fast.
A lot greater. You saw our budget. we're ordering billions and billions of dollars of new ships and new planes and equipment for our great soldiers. We are building it up. There's rarely been a time where we needed the protection of our incredible military more than right now, right here, and that's what we're going to do.
We believe in freedom, self-government, and individual rights. We cherish and defend -- thank you, it looks like it's in very good shape -- our Second Amendment. congratulations. [Applause] Yes, our Second Amendment is very, very sound again.
that would have been gonzo. It would have been gone, but i never had a doubt. We support the constitution of the United States and believe that judges should interpret the constitution as written and not make up new meaning for what they read. And finally, we believe that family and faith, not government and bureaucracy, are the foundation of our society.
You've heard me say it before on the campaign trail and I'll say it again tonight. In America, we don't worship government. We worship God. [Applause].
Tonight, we're going to set aside the cynics and the critics because we know exactly why they are so angry and so bitter. Day by day, week by week we are restoring our government's allegiance to its people, to its citizens, to the people that we all love. We are keeping our promises to the people, and yes, we are putting finally, finally, finally we are putting America first. [Applause, Audience chants USA].
After years and years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. [Applause] After spending billions of dollars defending other nations' borders, we are finally defending our borders. [Applause, Audience chants USA]. Don't even think about it, we will build the wall.
Don't even think about it. I watched the media as they say, well, he just had some fun during the campaign on the wall. That wasn't fun, folks. We're building that wall, and walls do work and we're going to have great people come into our country, but we're not gonna to put ourselves through the problems that we've had for so many years. [Applause]
After decades of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally going to rebuild our nation. [Audience boos]. They're pointing to a protester. Honestly, if you don't point, nobody's even going to know he's here. Weak voice, weak voice, don't worry. [Audience chants USA]. Boy, he's a young one.
he's going back home to mommy. Oh, is he in trouble. He's in trouble. He's in trouble.
And I'll bet his mommy voted for us, right? [Applause] By the way, so this morning I'm watching Fox News [crowd cheers] And they had some people on, and these were democrats that voted for trump. And they had this on. And so far if anything, they've gotten even more committed. But they had a man on this morning -- they had a man on this morning who was a Democrat his whole life.
He voted as a democrat, but he voted for -- I say us, I don't say me. He voted for us in the last election 2016. [Applause] And they said to him, so if the election were held now again, what would you do? And he effectively said, man, would I vote for Trump again, even faster. So his name is Gino de Fabio.
where is Gino? Gino, get over here, Gino. Whoa. Gino de Fabio!.
Anybody who knows me, friends of mine, people who love me it's worse for them, they know how it's been since President Trump started running for the election. How much I supported this guy, how much I love this guy, this guy's got something, he's the real deal. Everybody else came and said ""we're gonna fight for you,"" this is Youngstown, Mr. President, but this is also the Steel Valley.
Every one of these people love you, Sir. And I don't want to sound silly or anything, but i thought what would I say to the President if I ever got to meet him, which this is an honest to God over the top moment for me. I thought you know I'm just going to tell him something. And sir, like I said, thank you for Justice Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.
Right? That started it all. And then I apologize, I said Mr. President, thank you for Melania. Could we have a more outstanding First Lady? I'm probably going to be in trouble with my wife, but God bless that woman.
And then last thing I said and I don't think he thought I was going to take this much time but anybody that knows me, this is gonna happen, I said thank you sir for keeping the promises you made. To these 12,000 people and to the country. In my recommendation sir, look what you could do in the bastion of the Democratic party. I don't think there's anyone except Cuyahoga County who is more Democratic than us.
Look who you could draw. I go back to Washington, I would tell the Republicans and the Democrats, ""Look. I am going to go do my rallies. You got the agenda. Those people are voting for me and mine. Do what you want. Pass my agenda or we're going out on the road."" Thank you sir. An absolute honor. Thank you sir.
Thank you, Gino. What a man. I watched him this morning, I said, we got to find this guy, he's just a great person. Always a Democrat, now it's gone.
I'll tell you what, I rode through your beautiful roads coming up from the airport, and I was looking at some of those big once incredible job-producing factories, and my wife, Melania, said what happened? I said, those jobs have left Ohio. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. [Applause]. Don't move.
Don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Remember, i got a lot of credit. This is hard to believe but the press gave me a lot of credit because a number of years ago I said this is the time to buy a house during one of my speeches.
I said, go out and buy, and they did this big story, Trump predicted. Let me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Do not sell it.
We're going to get those values up. We're going to get those jobs coming back, and we're going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand new ones. It's going to happen. [Applause] We're gonna have it so that Americans can once again speak the magnificent words of Alexander Hamilton, ""here the people govern."" Political correctness for me is easy.
Sometimes they say he doesn't act Presidential. And I say, hey look, great schools, smart guy, it's so easy to act presidential but that's not gonna to get it done. In fact, I said it's much easier, by the way, to act presidential than what we're doing here tonight, believe me. And I said -- and I said with the exception of the late great Abraham Lincoln, i can be more presidential than any President that's ever held this office.
That I can tell you. It's real easy. [Applause] But sadly, we have to move a little faster than that. We will never be beholden to the lobbyists or the special interests.
We will never be silenced by the media. I want to protect America, and i want to protect the citizens of America. Your hopes are my hopes. Your dreams are my dreams.
I've had a great successful career. I've built a great, great business. This is the only thing that matters. This is the only thing that matters.
There is nothing else. Your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day. Here is just a small sample of what we have accomplished in just our first six months in office. And I'll say this and they always like to say, well, I don't know.
But I think that with few exceptions no president has done anywhere near what we've done in his first six months. Not even close. But they don't let you know. They don't want to write about it.
That unemployment last month hit a 16-year low. Since my election, we've added much more than 1 million jobs. Think of that. And remember I came in and some people said, don't say that.
I'd say, ""what do you have to lose?"" I talked about the inner city, and I talked about the crime and the problems and the lack of education, and I talked to my African-American friends and I said, vote for me, what the hell do you have to lose? Do you remember that? The Hispanic, the African-American, the inner cities. So now it just came out, African-Americans and teenagers are enjoying their lowest unemployment since just after the turn of the millennium. [Applause] That's pretty good, right? we've eliminated burdensome regulations at record speed and many, many more are coming off. And boy, have we put those coal miners and coal back on the map. You've seen that, haven't you? And all other forms of energy.
We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve. We have signed new legislation to hold federal workers accountable for the care they provide to our great, great veterans. Veterans Accountability Act, they've been trying to get that done for many, many, many years, even decades. And you understand why it was tough, but we got it done.
In fact, our secretary is with us tonight, David Shulkin, and we have some just incredible people here tonight, some of whom you've already met. But the job they're doing for the vets, having to do with choice, having to do with doctors, having to do with not having to wait online for days and days and days and getting sicker and sicker and sicker, where you could be taken care of immediately. Now you go out and you see a doctor. To protect American jobs and workers, I withdrew the united states from both the Trans-Pacific Partnership potential disaster and the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
Believe me. And if we don't negotiate a great deal with Mexico and Canada, we will terminate NAFTA and we'll start all over again. You remember when I was in Youngstown, I said we will either renegotiate NAFTA or we'll terminate it. So let's see what happens, but we're right now negotiating with the heads of Mexico, a good man, the President, and the Prime Minister of Canada, a good man.
Let's see what happens. But we will no longer be the foolish people. We will no longer be the stupid people that get taken care of so badly by our politicians because they don't know what they're doing. [Applause] We will always work with our friends and partners, but we will never again sacrifice Ohio jobs or jobs from any state in our union to enrich other countries which has been what is happening to this country. [Audience chants USA]
And by the way, while we're on it, the Iran deal which may be the single worst deal I've ever seen drawn by anybody, if that deal doesn't conform to what it's supposed to conform to, there's going to be big, big problems for them. That I can tell you. You're going to see that. Believe me.
You would have thought when that deal was made by Secretary Kerry, maybe the worst negotiator I've ever seen, you would have thought that Iran would have said, thank you, United States. We can't believe you gave us between $100 billion and $150 billion when they were ready to fail. We can't believe you gave us $1.7 billion in cash. You know what that looks like? You would have thought they would have said, ""thank you, United States, we really love you very much."" Instead, they've become emboldened.
That won't take place much longer. [Applause] The great president from the state of Ohio, William McKinley and you know William McKinley, does anybody know who the hell he is? Do you know who he is? William McKinley understood that when America protects our workers and our industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. We don't protect our people. We don't protect.
Trade comes in, goods come in. I was with Harley-Davidson, a great company from Wisconsin. Who has a Harley-Davidson? A lot of you. [Applause] They came to the White House and they said to me, ""yeah, it's tough going outside of the United States.
We're doing great in the United States but when we sell a motorcycle to certain countries, we have as much as a 100% tax to pay."" And I said, ""tell me, when they sell back to us, meaning reciprocal, so when they sell back to us, what tax do we charge them?"" The answer is zero. [Booing] Those days are going to be over very soon. [Applause] Unfortunately, like everything else, there are so many restrictions on doing what's right for our country, there's so much red tape, but don't worry, we're getting through it. The red tape, you would think we could just do it.
Wouldn't you think you could say, ""hey, you charge us 100%, we're going to charge you 100%?"" Then either you'll get the money or you'll both drop it, right? We can't do that. We've got to go back to Congress, who other than health care today, has been made some very bad deals, okay? So we're going to start enriching our country. We're going to start bringing back our jobs, and we will be fools no longer, folks. We'll be fools no longer.
Every single President on Mt. Rushmore Ã now here's what i do. I'd ask whether or not you think I will someday be on Mt. Rushmore, but, but here's the problem.
If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, ""he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore."" So I won't say it, okay? I won't say it. But every president -- they'll say it anyway tomorrow. ""Trump thinks he should be on Mt. Rushmore.""
Isn't that terrible? What a group. What a dishonest group of people, I'll tell you. [Applause] And you know the funny thing is that you would think they'd want to see our country be great again. You would really think so.
But they don't. Someday they'll explain it to me why. Every president on Mt. Rushmore believed in protecting American industry. We have to protect our industry. And now we are going to start, we are reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation again. Bob Kraft, the owner of the New England patriots, I don't know if you like New England but they have a hell of a team. [Booing] That's okay.
But he came to the Oval Office and he brought a sheet with him that just came out. Manufacturing enthusiasm in the United States is at an all-time high. Isn't that great? To me that's so great. because we're going to bring back our jobs, bring back our wealth, and we are going to bring back our dreams, and we are going to bring back, once again our sovereignty as a nation.
As a nation. [Audience chants USA] Since I took office we have cut illegal immigration on our southern border by record numbers. 78%. [Audience chants Build the Wall] Record, record numbers.
And in fact, the ICE, folks I'll tell you what, and the border patrol police, they are phenomenal people. They're working with General Kelly. And just so you understand, we've already started fixing much of the good wall that's already there. We've already started fixing it. But we are breaking records.
And it was actually told to me the other day by somebody in Mexico that's very high up, said it's incredible because their southern border is getting very little traffic. Nobody is coming anymore because they know they can't get through our southern border. So they don't even come. [Applause] Never again will America surrender the security of our people, the safety of our communities or the sovereignty of our nation.
We are cracking down hard on the foreign criminal gangs that have brought illegal drugs, violence, horrible bloodshed to peaceful neighborhoods all across our country. We are throwing MS-13 the hell out of here so fast. You know, we're actually -- hard to believe that we're talking about our great country. We are actually liberating towns and cities.
We are liberating Ã people are screaming from their windows, thank you, thank you to the border patrol and to General Kelly's great people that come in and grab the thugs and throw them the hell out. We are liberating our towns and we are liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that? [Audience chants Build the Wall] Earlier in year and immigration and customs enforcement conducted the largest single raid of transnational gangs in the history of our country. We are dismantling and destroying the bloodthirsty criminal gangs, and well, I will just tell you in, we're not doing it in a politically correct fashion.
We're doing it rough. Our guys are rougher than their guys. I asked one of our great generals, ""how tough are our people? How tough are they?"" He said, ""Sir, you don't want to know about it."" Then I saw one guy come out, a customs officer who is a monster. I said, ""so general, you think i could take that guy in a fight?"" He said, ""Mr.
President, sir i don't even want to think about it."" I said ""you're right, actually."" We have tough people. Our people are tougher than their people. Our people are tougher and stronger and meaner and smarter than the gangs. One by one we are finding the illegal gang members, drug dealers, thieves, robbers, criminals and killers.
And we are sending them the hell back home where they came from. And once they are gone, we will never let them back in. Believe me. The predators and criminal aliens who poison our communities with drugs and prey on innocent young people, these beautiful, beautiful, innocent young people will, will find no safe haven anywhere in our country.
And you've seen the stories about some of these animals. They don't want to use guns, because it's too fast and it's not painful enough. So they'll take a young, beautiful girl, 16, 15, and others and they slice them and dice them with a knife because they want them to go through excruciating pain before they die. And these are the animals that we've been protecting for so long.
Well, they're not being protected any longer, folks. And that is why my administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities. American cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, for people that look up to the law, for people that respect the law, not for criminals and gang members that we want the hell out of our country. [Applause] Sanctuary cities legislation has passed the house, along with Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was brutally killed by a five-time deported illegal immigrant.
We are asking the Senate to vote on sanctuary cities and Kate's Law legislation. We've got to get it passed. The Trump administration has the backs of our ICE Officers, our border patrol agents. And yes, our great police officers.
And we have their backs 100%. We are going to also protect them, like they protect us. This month in Chicago, there have been more than 2 homicide victims per day. What the hell is going on in Chicago? Better tell that Mayor to get tough, because it's not working what they're doing.
We are going to get criminals off our streets. And we are going to make America safe again. We also strongly believe that our borders must always be closed to terrorism and extremism. We don't want radical Islamic terrorists in our country.
We've seen the total devastation in Europe. And the attack from New York to Boston to San Bernardino. Exactly one year ago next month I came right here to Youngstown to deliver a major address on how my administration would protect our country from terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism. We only want to admit those into our country who share our values, who love our people and who always will love our people.
We don't want people coming into our country who have bad intentions even before they start. [Applause] We also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able to support themselves financially and should not be able to use welfare for themselves or the household for a period of at least five years. As we speak, we are working with two wonderful senators, Tom Cotton and David Purdue, to create a new immigration system for America. Instead of today's low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in.
People that have never worked, people that are criminals, anybody comes in. We want a merit-based system. One that protects workers our workers, our taxpayers, and one that protects our economy. We want it merit-based.
We want people that work really hard in their country and that are going to come into our country and work really, really hard. We don't want people that come into our country and immediately go on welfare and stay there for the rest of their lives. We're not going to do it. We are working every single day to move the legislation that serves the interests of the American people.
As we discussed earlier, at the very top of the list is health care reform. With Obamacare, the Washington obstructionists, meaning Democrats, made big promising to the American people. And every single promise they made turned out to be a lie. I can have your doctor.
You can have your plan. Do you remember? 28 times. You can have your doctor. You can have your plan. I know Democrats who heard that and they would have never have voted for it but they voted for it because they believed the lies of President Obama. For seven years every Republican running for office promised to repeal and replace in disastrous law. Now they must keep their promise. The Senate is working not only to repeal Obamacare but to deliver great health care for the American people.
Any senator who votes against repeal and replace is telling America that they are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, and I predict they'll have a lot of problems. In West Virginia, recent premiums have gone up 169% since Obamacare went into effect. In Alaska over 200%. And the deductibles have gone through the roof.
You'll never even get to use it. In Missouri, premiums have shot up 145% under Obamacare. In Pennsylvania the cost of Obamacare insurance has more than doubled, and the coverage has become horrific. It's time for Democrats to stop resisting.
That's their term. Resist. Resist. They have to do, finally, what's right for the American people. But probably we'll do it ourselves. Because today we won 51 to 50 and didn't get one Democrat vote. Think of that. [Applause] My administration is working every single day to heed and honor the will of the voters.
That includes working on one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. And actually if I get what I want it will be the single biggest tax cut in American history. We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world, and this will really bring them down to one of the lowest. And we really have no choice.
We will have growth. We will have everything that we've dreamed of having. It's time to let Americans keep more of their own money. It's time to bring new companies to our shores and to create a new era of growth, prosperity and wealth.
We want millions of Americans to be lifted from welfare to work and from dependence to independence. One of the ways we will put more Americans to work is by rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure. That is why I have called on legislators to pass a bill that generates $1 trillion in new infrastructure investments. We're going to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our airports.
We are going to fix all of the things that once made us great. And we are going to use American iron, American steel, American aluminum. We will buy American and will hire, finally, American. We want once again to have the best infrastructure.
The best schools, the best jobs, the best factories. And we want products that proudly carry the label ""made in the USA."" We want this country that we love so much, America, to be strong, proud and free. Which means America must also be united. Because when America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
Although I'll be totally honest with you even if it's not united we're unstoppable so don't worry. We're gonna to be unstoppable either way but it would be nice, wouldn't it? Our small differences are nothing compared to our common history, common values and common future. Wes hare one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. Now it is up to us to preserve the birth right of freedom and justice, the birth right of prosperity that our ancestors won for us with their sweat, with their sweat, with their blood, with their work, with their muscle, with their brain.
They won it for us and we're gonna make it bigger and better and stronger than it ever was before. It's time to look past the old divisions. They're tired, really tired, politicians. And the stale debates of the past, and to finally come together as one nation under god.
We have no choice. We cannot and never will back down. We will never, ever give up. We cannot fail. And if we remember what unites us, then I promise you we will not fail. We cannot fail. We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, God bless the state of Ohio. Thank you everybody."
2017-07-24,"Speech: Donald Trump at the National Scout Jamboree, Glen Jean, WV","Glen Jean, WV, United States","[-81.1501016, 37.9265014]",donald-trump-speech-national-scout-jamboree-july-24-2017,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. I am thrilled to be here. Thrilled. And if you think that was an easy trip, you're wrong, but I am thrilled -- 19th Boy Scout Jamboree -- wow -- and to address such a tremendous group. Boy, you have a lot of people here. The press will say it's about 200 people. [Laughter] It looks like about 45,000 people. You set a record today. You set a record. That's a great honor, believe me.
Tonight, we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. -- you've been hearing about with the fake news and all of that. We're going to put that aside. And instead we're going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young Scouts can achieve your dreams. What to think of -- what I've been thinking about -- you want to achieve your dreams. I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? Right? [Applause]
There are many great honors that come with the job of being President of the United States, but looking out at this incredible gathering of mostly young patriots -- mostly young -- I'm especially proud to speak to you as the honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America. [Applause, Audience Chants USA]
You are the young people of character and integrity who will serve as leaders in our communities, and uphold the sacred values of our nation.
I want to thank Boy Scouts President Randall Stephenson, Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh, Jamboree Chairman Ralph de la Vega, and the thousands of volunteers who have made this a life-changing experience for all of you, and when they asked me to be here I said absolutely, yes. [Applause]
Finally, and we can't forget these people, I especially want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here tonight. Thank you for making scouting possible. Thank you, mom and dad -- troop leaders.
When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts, you are not only shaping young lives, you are shaping the future of America. The United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. No better. The values, traditions, and skills you learn here will serve you throughout your lives, and just as importantly they will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and in the present, will serve your country. The Scouts believe in putting America first. [Applause]
You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp. And it's not a good place. In fact today I said we ought to change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or, perhaps, to the word sewer. But it's not good. Not good. And I see what's going on, and believe me I'd much rather be with you. That I can tell you. [Applause]
I'll tell you the reason that I love this and the reason that I really wanted to be here is because as President, I rely on former Boy Scouts every single day, and so do the American people. It's amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level of our great government. Many of my top advisors in the White House were Scouts. Ten members of my cabinet were Scouts. Can you believe that? Ten. [Applause]
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is not only a Boy Scout, he's your former national president. [Applause] The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence -- good guy -- was a Scout, and it meant so much to him. Some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when Mike was the governor of Indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. And by the way, where are our Indiana Scouts tonight?
I wonder if the television cameras will follow you. They don't like doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don't like doing that. Hi, folks. A lot of love in this big, beautiful place. A lot of love, and a lot of love for our country. There's a lot of love for our country.
Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. Come here, Ryan. Ryan is an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. Pretty good. And by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. He makes sure that we leave our national parks and federal lands better than we found them, in the best Scouting tradition. So thank you very much, Ryan. [Applause]
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, of Texas, an Eagle Scout from the Great State. The first time he came to the national jamboree was in 1964. He was very young then. And Rick told me just a little while ago, it totally changed his life. So, Rick, thank you very much for being here. And we're doing a lot with energy. [Applause]
And very soon, Rick, we will be an energy exporter. Isn't that nice -- an energy exporter? In other words we'll be selling our energy instead of buying it from everybody all over the globe. So that's good. We will be energy dominant. And I'll tell you what, the folks in West Virginia who were so nice to me, boy, have we kept our promise. We are going on and on. So we love West Virginia. We want to thank you.
Where's West Virginia by the way? Thank you. Secretary Tom Price is also here. Today Dr. Price still lives the Scout Oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy as our Secretary of Health and Human Services. And he's doing a great job. And hopefully, he's going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that's really hurting us, folks. [Applause, Audience Chants USA]
By the way, you going to get the votes? He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better -- otherwise, I'll say, Tom, you're fired. I'll get somebody. [Applause] He better get Senator Capito to vote for it. You got to get the other senators to vote for it. It's time. After seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They better do it. Hopefully they'll do it.
As we can see just by looking at our government, in America, Scouts lead the way. And another thing I've noticed -- and I've noticed it all my life -- there is a tremendous spirit with being a Scout, more so than almost anything I can think of. So whatever is going on, keep doing it. It's incredible to watch. Believe me. [Applause]
Each of these leaders will tell you that their road to American success -- and you have to understand, their American success, and they are a great, great story was paved with the patriotic American values as traditions they learned in the Boy Scouts. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the adventures in your lives, you will be able to say the same: I got my start as a Scout just like these incredibly great people that are doing such a good job for our country. So that's going to happen. [Applause]
Boy Scout values are American values, and great Boy Scouts become great, great Americans. As the Scout Law says: ""A Scout is trustworthy, loyal"" -- we could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that. [Audience recites Scout Law: ""helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent."" Applause]
That was very impressive. [Laughter] You've heard that before. But here you learn the rewards of hard work and perseverance. Never ever give up, never quit. Persevere. Never, ever quit. You learn the satisfaction of building a roaring campfire, reaching a mountain summit, or earning a merit badge after mastering a certain skill. There's no better feeling than an achievement that you've earned with your own sweat, tears, resolve, hard work. There's nothing like it. Do you agree with that? [Audience Calls ""Yes""]
I'm waving to people back there so small I can't even see them. Man, this is a lot of people. Turn those cameras back there, please. That is so incredible. By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible, massive crowd, record-setting is going to be shown on television tonight? One percent or zero? [Applause]
The fake media will say: President Trump -- and you know what this is -- President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today. That's some -- that is some crowd. [Applause] Fake media. Fake news. Thank you. And I'm honored by that, by the way, all of you people they can't even see you. So thank you. I hope you can hear.
Through scouting you also learn to believe in yourselves -- so important -- to have confidence in your ability, and to take responsibility for your own life. When you face down new challenges, and you will have plenty of them, develop talents you never thought possible, and lead your teammates through daring trials, you discover that you can handle anything. And you learn it by being a scout. It's great. [Applause]
You can do anything. You can be anything you want to be. But in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. You have to find your passion. No matter what they tell you -- if you don't -- I love you, too. I don't know. It's a nice guy. Hey, what am I going to do? He sounds like a nice person. He, he, he, he. Thank you. I do. I do love you.
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a jamboree? [Audience Yells No] And we'll be back. We'll be back. The answer is no, but we'll be back. In life, in order to be successful, and you people are well on the road to success, you have to find out what makes you excited. What makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? You have to find it.
If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will gain momentum, and look -- you have to, you need to. The word momentum -- you will gain that momentum, and each success will create another success. The word momentum.
I'll tell you a story that's very interesting for me when I was young. There was a man named William Levitt -- Levittowns, you have some here, you have some in different states. Anybody ever hear of Levittown?
And he was a very successful man. He was a homebuilder -- became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. And he built homes, and at night he'd go to these major sites with teams of people and he'd scour the sites for nails and sawdust and small pieces of wood. And they'd clean the site so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of money for his company.
And he sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. At the time especially -- this was a long time ago -- sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. I won't go any more than that because you're Boy Scouts, so I'm not going to tell you what he did. [Audience Boos]
Should I tell you? Should I tell you? [Audience Calls ""Yes""] Oh, you're Boy Scouts, but you know life. You know life. So -- look at you. Who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right? So he had a very, very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate. And they didn't know anything about building homes, and they didn't know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it -- and the scraps of wood.
This was a big conglomerate based in New York City, and after about a ten year period they were losing a lot with it. It didn't mean anything to them, and they couldn't sell it. So they called William Levitt up and they said, would you like to buy back your company, and he said yes, I would. He so badly wanted it, he got bored with this life of yachts and sailing and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. You won't get bored, right? You know, truthfully, you're workers. You'll get bored too. Believe me.
Of course, having a good few years like that isn't so bad. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of empty land. And he worked hard in getting it zoning, and he worked hard on starting to develop. And in the end he failed, and he failed badly. Lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older. And I saw him at a cocktail party, and it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.
It was the party of Steve Ross who was one of the great people -- he came up and discovered -- really founded -- Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party.
And I was doing well so I got invited to the party. I was very young, and I go in -- but I'm in the real estate business -- and I see 100 people, some of whom I recognize and they're big in the entertainment business. And I see, sitting in the corner, was a little old man who was all by himself.
Nobody was talking to him. I immediately recognized that that man was the once great William Levitt of Levittown, and I immediately went over -- I wanted to talk to him more than the Hollywood show business communications people.
So I went over and talked to him, and I said, Mr. Levitt, I'm Donald Trump. He said I know. I said, Mr. Levitt, how are you doing? He goes, not well, not well at all. And I knew that, but he said not well at all. And he explained what was happening and how bad it has been and how hard it has been. And I said what exactly happened? Why did this happen to you? You're one of the greats ever in our industry.
Why did this happen to you? And he said, Donald, I lost my momentum. I lost my momentum. A word you never hear when you're talking about success. When some of these guys that never made ten cents, they're on television giving you things about how you're going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape.
But I'll tell you, it was very sad, and I never forgot that moment. And I thought about it, and it's exactly true. He lost his momentum. Meaning, he took this period of time off long -- years -- and then when he got back, he didn't have that same momentum.
In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum, and if you don't have it that's okay. Because you're going to go on and you're going to learn and you're going to do things that are great. But you have to know about the word momentum.
But the big thing: Never quit. Never give up. Do something you love. When you do something you love -- as a Scout I see that you love it. But when you do something that you love you'll never fail. What you're going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. You're ultimately going to be successful, and remember this, you're not working. Because when you're doing something that you love like I do -- of course I love my business, but this is a little bit different.
Who thought this was going to happen? We're having a good time. We're doing a good job. Doing a good job. But when you do something that you love, remember this, it's not work. So you'll work 24/7, you're going to work all the time, and at the end of a year you're not really working. You don't think of it as work. When you're not doing something that you like or when you're forced in to do something that you really don't like, that's called work. And it's hard work and tedious work.
So as much as you can, do something that you love. Work hard, and never ever give up, and you're going to be tremendously successful. Tremendously successful. [Applause]
Now with that, I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up -- since the election November 8th. Do we remember that date? Was that a beautiful date? What a date. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th, where they said -- these dishonest people -- where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump? They forgot about the forgotten people.
By the way, they're not forgetting about the forgotten people anymore. They're going crazy trying to figure it out. But I told them, far too late. It's far too late. But do you remember that incredible night with the maps and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable, and they didn't know what to say? [Applause]
And you know we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College -- popular vote is much easier. Because New York, California, Illinois -- you have to practically run the East Coast. And we did. We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Pennsylvania. [Applause] We won and won. So when they said, there is no way to victory, there is no way to 270. I went to Maine four times because it's one vote, and we won. But we won -- one vote. I went there because I kept hearing we're at 269. But then Wisconsin came in. Many, many years -- Michigan came in.
And we worked hard there. My opponent didn't work hard there because she was told -- [Audience Boos] She was told she was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute, the car industry is moving to Mexico. Why is she going to move -- she's there. Why are they allowing it to move?
And by the way, do you see those car industry -- do you see what's happening, how they're coming back to Michigan? They're coming back to Ohio. They're starting to peel back in. [Applause] And we go to Wisconsin -- now, Wisconsin hadn't been won in many, many years by a Republican. But we go to Wisconsin, and we had tremendous crowds. And I'd leave these massive crowds. I'd say, why are we going to lose this state?
The polls -- that's also fake news. They're fake polls. But the polls are saying -- but we won Wisconsin. So I have to tell you what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for Make America Great Again. [Applause, chants USA]
And I'll tell you what, we are, indeed, making America great again. What's going on is incredible. [Applause] We had the best jobs report in 16 years. The stock market on a daily basis is hitting an all-time high. We're going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars from companies that can't get their money back into this country, and that money is going to be used to help rebuild America. We're doing things that nobody ever thought was possible.
And we've just started. It's just the beginning. Believe me. [Applause] In the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? [Audience Yells Yes] You learn to contribute to your communities, to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. You pledge to help other people at all times. [Applause] In the Scout Oath, you pledge on your honor to do your best and to do your duty to God and your country. [Applause]
And by the way, under the Trump administration, you'll be saying, merry Christmas again when you go shopping. Believe me. Merry Christmas. [Applause] They've been downplaying that little, beautiful phrase. You're going to be saying, merry Christmas again, folks. [Applause]
But the words duty, country, and God are beautiful words. In other words, basically what you're doing is you're pledging to be a great American patriot. [Applause] For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service to helping people in your communities. [Applause]
Incredible. That's an incredible stat. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service by the end of this jamboree -- 100,000. [Applause] When natural disaster strikes, when people face hardship, when the beauty and glory of our outdoor spaces must be restored and taken care of, America turns to the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts never, ever, ever let us down. [Applause]
Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on you because we know the values that you live by. [Applause] Your values are the same values that have always kept America strong, proud, and free. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of additional money that we're putting back into our military? Billions of dollars. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are so great to us.
We love our vets. We love our soldiers. And we love our police, by the way. Firemen, police -- we love our police. Those are all special people. Uniformed services. Two days ago, I traveled to Norfolk, Virginia to commission an American aircraft carrier into the fleet of the United States Navy. It's the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it's named for an Eagle Scout, the USS Gerald R. Ford. Everywhere it sails, that great Scout's name will be feared and revered, because that ship will be a symbol of American power, prestige, and strength. [Applause]
Our nation honors President Gerald R. Ford today because he lived his life the scouting way. Boy Scouts celebrate American patriots, especially the brave members of our armed forces. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
American hearts are warmed every year when we read about Boy Scouts placing thousands and thousands of flags next to veterans' gravesites all across the country. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. You should take great pride in the example you set for every citizen of our country to follow. [Applause]
Generations of American Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to same law. You inherit a noble American tradition, and as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of who you are and the principles you hold dear and stand by. Wear your values as your badge of honor. What you've done, few have done before you. What you've done is incredible. What you've done is admired by all. So I want to congratulate you, Boy Scouts. [Applause]
Let your scouting oath guide your path from this day forward. Remember your duty. Honor your history. Take care of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. [Applause]
You are very special people. You're special in the lives of America. You're special to me. But if you do what we say, I promise you that you will live scouting's adventure every single day of your life, and you will win, win, win and help people in doing so. [Applause]
Your lives will have meaning and purpose and joy. You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible, things that you said could never, ever happen are already happening for you.
And if you do these things -- and if you refuse to give in to doubt or to fear -- then you will help to make America great again. You will be proud of yourself, be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love. [Applause, Audience Chants USA] And never, ever forget, America is proud of you. [Applause]
This is a very, very special occasion for me. I've known so many Scouts over the years. Winners. I've known so many great people. They've been taught so well, and they love their heritage. But this is very special for me. And I just want to end by saying very importantly: God bless you. God bless the Boy Scouts. God bless the United States of America.
Go out. Have a great time in life. Compete and go out and show me that there is nobody -- nobody -- like a Boy Scout. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause]"
2017-07-22,"Speech: Donald Trump Commissions the USS Gerald R. Ford in Norfolk, Virginia","Norfolk, VA, United States","[-76.28587259999999, 36.8507689]",donald-trump-speech-uss-gerald-r-ford-commissioning-july-22-2017,"Thank you very much, Secretary Mattis, for that wonderful introduction and for your devoted service to our nation. Nobody has done it like you. I'm thrilled to be back on this magnificent ship for this historic moment with the amazing men and women of the United States Navy. [Applause]
I was with you four months ago, and I knew that I had to be here today, and I told you I'd be back to congratulate you and the crew and everybody involved on commissioning the newest, largest, and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of this world. That's a big achievement.
After today, wherever this ship sails, you will all carry a proud title: plankowner of the USS Gerald R. Ford. [Applause] For the rest of your lives, you'll be able to tell your friends and family that you served on the greatest ship in the United States Navy and, in my opinion, on the greatest ship anywhere in the world. Everyone should take a moment to celebrate this incredible achievement.
I want to thank the many public servants who have joined us here today: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Governor Snyder, Governor McAuliffe, Senator Wicker, and members of Congress, Secretary Stackley, Admiral Richardson, senior military leaders, and, of course, the great Captain McCormack. [Applause]
Captain, I know you will exemplify integrity at the helm. And have a good time doing it, Captain. Proud of you. Thanks to the entire Ford family -- Susan, Jack, Steve, and Mike -- for all that you've done to support this ship on its voyage. Thank you, Susan. [Applause] Thank you.
I also want to recognize two other people who were very special to President Ford. Thank you, Vice President Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. Thank you. [Applause] They look great. They look great.
As we put this stunning ship into the service of our nation, we must also pay tribute to the thousands of citizens, military and civilian, who helped design and build her. Their love of country has been poured into every rivet and bulkhead on this vessel. You hammered, chiseled, and sculpted this mighty hull.
You were there when the first steel was cut, when the turbines first roared to life, and when those beautiful bronze propellers first began to spin -- and spin they did. And now you are here to witness the moment when your incredible work of art becomes the pride of the United States Navy and a symbol of American power and prestige, no matter where in the world you go.
American steel and American hands have constructed a 100,000-ton message to the world: American might is second to none, and we're getting bigger, and better, and stronger every day of my administration. That I can tell you. [Applause]
Wherever this vessel cuts through the horizon, our allies will rest easy and our enemies will shake with fear because everyone will know that America is coming and America is coming strong. [Applause]
To every worker from Newport News Shipbuilding and every craftsman and engineer who helped build this incredible fortress on the sea, today we salute you. Thank you. [Applause] Your skill and your grit build the instruments of war that preserve peace. This ship is the deterrent that keeps us from having to fight in the first place. But this ship also ensures that if a fight does come, it will always end the same way; we will win, win, win. We will never lose. We will win. [Applause]
When it comes to battle, we don't want a fair fight. We want just the opposite. We demand victory, and we will have total victory, believe me. [Applause] Having the best technology and equipment is only one part of the American military dominance. Our true strength is our people. Our greatest weapon is all of you. Our nation endures because we have citizens who love America and who are willing to fight for America. [Applause] We are so very blessed with warriors who are willing to serve America in the greatest fighting force in the history -- the United States military.
Today this ship officially begins its role in the noble military history of our great nation. In a few moments, I will commission this wonderful, beautiful, but very, very powerful warship. Captain McCormack will assume command. He will set the first watch, and then the crew of the Gerald R. Ford will man the ship and bring her to life. [Applause]
A ship is only as good as the people who serve on it, and the American sailor is the best anywhere in the world. Among you are great welders, radar technicians, machine operators, and pilots. You take pride in your work and America takes pride in you. We love you. We are proud of you. Thank you. [Applause]
But that is why it is so fitting that this ship is named after a sailor of tremendous character, integrity, and wisdom. You know that, Susan. Gerald Ford was raised in American heartland. He grew up in Grand Rapids and became an Eagle Scout. He played football at the University of Michigan on a team that won two national championships. And listen to this: On that great team, he was named MVP. Not bad.
He then went to Yale Law School, and after Pearl Harbor, he volunteered to serve. President Ford joined the Navy and asked to be sent to sea. He wanted to do that very badly. He never really knew why; he felt it was a calling. He was assigned to a new carrier -- the Monterey -- becoming a plankowner himself on its commissioning in 1943.
From there, he sailed to the Pacific and saw action -- and a lot of action -- in the Pacific War. Like so many others of his generation, Gerald Ford returned home and started a family. He ran for Congress, where he served the people of Michigan with honor for many years. From there, he became Vice President and then President of the United States of America.
With this ship, we honor him for his lifetime of selfless and distinguished service. We also remember his wife, Betty -- I remember her well -- and we honor the bravery she showed in living her life so that her experiences could help others. Susan, she was a great woman -- a great woman. [Applause]
Gerald Ford said that his time in the Navy convinced him that our lack of military preparation before World War II has only encouraged our enemies to fight harder and harder and harder. He learned a lot. In the future, Ford said, I felt the United States had to be strong. Never again could we allow our military to be anything but the absolute best. If he could see this ship today, President Gerald Ford would see his vision brought to life, and he would see his legacy of service being carried on by each and every one of you. [Applause]
Gerald Ford embodied American values like few others: love of family, love of freedom, and, most of all, love of country. He knew that patriotism is the heartbeat of a nation. He knew that we must love our country in order to protect it. And he knew that we must have pride in our history if we are going to have confidence in our future.
The men and women of America's Armed Services are part of a living history. You uphold timeless customs and traditions, and you protect our nation and our freedom for the next generation to come. You are fulfilling your duty to this nation, and now it is the job of our government to fulfill its duty to you. [Applause]
For years, our government has subjected the military to unpredictable funding and a devastating defense sequester. You remember that? Sequester -- not good. This has led to deferred maintenance, a lack of investment in new equipment and technology, and a shortfall in military readiness. In other words, it's been a very, very bad period of time for our military. That is why we reached a deal to secure an additional $20 billion for defense this year -- and it's going up -- and why I asked Congress for another $54 billion for next year.
Now we need Congress to do its job and pass the budget that provides for higher, stable, and predictable funding levels for our military needs that our fighting men and women deserve -- and you will get, believe me. President Trump, I will tell you -- you will get it. Don't worry about it. But I don't mind getting a little hand, so call that congressman and call that senator and make sure you get it. [Applause]
And by the way, you can also call those senators to make sure you get healthcare. [Applause] We must end the defense sequester once and for all. We must also reform defense acquisitions to ensure that we are getting the best equipment at the best prices so that our dollars are used only for the best interests of our country and those who serve. We do not want cost overruns. We want the best equipment, but we want it built ahead of schedule and we want it build under budget. [Applause]
This is the very least we can do for the patriots who have volunteered to give their sweat, their blood, and, if they must, their very lives for our great nation. The commissioning of this new American carrier marks the renewal of our commitment to a future of American greatness. Greater than ever before, remember that -- greater than ever before.
Just moments from now, the Captain will set the first watch on the USS Gerald R. Ford and, with God's grace, a watch will stand until the day she is decommissioned 50 years or more from now.
Most of you who will man this ship today are just about 20 years old. Together, you are embarking on a truly great adventure. The journey will require all of your talents, all of your efforts, and all of your heart. As you know, the sea holds many challenges and threats. But starting today, you will face, together as a team aboard this ship, which is your responsibility and your home.
Three generations of Americans will eventually man these decks. Perhaps even some of your own children and grandchildren someday. You will inspire many more American patriots to follow your lead and to serve. And one day, when you are old and have lived a long and hopefully happy and successful life, you may find yourselves back aboard this ship surrounded by your family to mark its decommissioning. And on that day, our entire nation will honor not just this carrier, it will honor you and the role you will have played in keeping America safe, strong, and free.
To every patriot who will serve on this ship today and throughout history, I say this: Keep the watch, protect her, defend her, and love her. Good luck and Godspeed. Thank you to the Ford family, and thank you to every sailor in the greatest navy on Earth. God bless you, God bless the Gerald R. Ford, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. God bless you all. [Applause]
Thank you, Mr. President. And I would be honored if you would place Gerald R. Ford in commission. Will the guests please rise. Ship's company, attention.
I hereby place United States Ship Gerald R. Ford in commission. May God bless and guide this warship and all who shall sail in her. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-07-21,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-july-21-2017,"My fellow Americans. On Monday, I signed a Presidential proclamation declaring this to be Made in America Week. We believe that our country is stronger, safer and more prosperous when we make more of our goods and our products right here in the USA. When we purchase products made in America, the wealth, revenue and jobs all stay in our country, to be enjoyed by our people.
Since we first won our independence, our founders and many of our greatest leaders have promoted that we should afford a special level of protection to the products and goods manufactured within our borders. They understood that as a nation, we have common bonds with our fellow citizens and common obligations to each other.
Making and buying made in America products brings us closer and strengthens the ties that link us all together. For too long, our government's policies have punished production in America while rewarding and encouraging the movement of production overseas, which is totally ridiculous.
The result has been the loss of numerous industries, the decimation of entire communities and years of sluggish growth, and flat wages. Throughout American history, our nation's best leaders have believed in the importance of protecting our domestic industry. This includes every president on Mount Rushmore.
George Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young nation could become truly independent. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Americans should choose products made in America whenever possible. And by the way I'm asking you to do that. Abraham Lincoln warned that abandoning the policies that protect American industry would produce want and ruin among our people.
Theodore Roosevelt stated at his first message to Congress that reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. James Monroe called on our nation to cherish and sustain our manufacturers. James Garfield said of our nation's manufactures, to them the country owes the splendor of the position at halls before the world.
William McKinley believed that when America protects our workers and industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people. And Calvin Coolidge stated that protecting American industry enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people, anytime, anywhere on earth ever enjoyed.
We are now under the Trump administration, reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation. We are fighting to provide a level playing field for American workers and industries. Other countries will cease taking advantage of us. Believe me, we're going to build works of beauty and wonder with American hands, American grit and American iron, aluminium and steel
No longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth. Instead, we will follow two simple, but very crucial rules. We will buy American and we will hire American. Already, we have created over a million jobs this year, and doing even better than anticipated. We're just getting started. Believe me, we're just getting started.
For every job that comes back to this country, and every factory that reopens, and every town that is revitalized, we aren't just restoring American wealth. We are restoring American pride. We're restoring America's future, a future where millions will be lifted from welfare to work, where children will grow up in safe and vibrant communities, and where our nation will stand stronger than ever before.
And, most importantly, it will be a future in which you, our citizens, always come first. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. We are truly making it great again."
2017-07-14,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Paris, France",France,"[2.213749, 46.227638]",donald-trump-weekly-address-july-14-2017,"My fellow Americans. Next week, the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the Obamacare disaster. Obamacare has wreaked havoc on American lives and if we don't replace it, the calamity will only get worse and I mean get worse by a lot. Here's just one story, representative of so many others.
Carrie Couey and her husband are cattle ranches. They have six children and the youngest is autistic. Her family's rates under Obamacare skyrocketed, eventually costing the Couey's three times more than their previous plan.
They were dropped from health insurance four times under Obamacare. When I met with Carrie in March, she told us that her family couldn't afford the equipment they needed to do the jobs while paying these crushing insurance premiums. Americans, like Carrie and her family, desperately need relief from this terrible, terrible law.
The Democratic politicians who passed Obamacare made many big promises, but they turned out to be lies. Absolute total lies. They promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500. Instead, premiums have skyrocketed by numbers that nobody can even believe, sometimes many, many thousands of dollars. They promised that if you like your plan, you could keep your plan. Instead, millions of American family saw their plans canceled.
They promised Obamacare would offer better options for American families, but in the past two years, half the insurance companies have pulled out and left the individual market. And today, Americans, in one-third of all counties, have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and they probably will shortly have no insurers at all. The Senate health care bill stops the Obamacare disaster, expands choice and drives down costs, and I want to tell you: the Republican senators are working very hard to get something. That's going to be really, really good. The opposite of the big lie, which was Obamacare.
The bill would reduce premiums by 30 percent or more by 2020. It allows states freedom to escape even more of Obamacare's rules and create innovative health care solutions for their citizens. In other words, we'll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states who can better provide and who know better what to do.
It provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market. The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free health savings accounts and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums. This plan provides states with a much needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs.
It maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American, and American child who is currently on the program. It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance and with these much-needed long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net.
For our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit, so it would be good for the federal government. It will cost you less money by a lot and it'll be a much better plan. You can't do better than that. When I ran for president, I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare. I am pleased to report that we are very, very close to ending this health care nightmare. We are so close. The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want the affordability they need and the quality they deserve in health care. It's a common-sense approach that restores the sacred doctor-patient relationship and you're going to finally have great healthcare at a lower price.
Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America."
2017-07-07,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Hamburg, Germany",Germany,"[10.451526, 51.165691]",donald-trump-weekly-address-july-7-2017,"My fellow Americans. Here at the White House, we are dedicating the month of July to three of our favorite words: Made in America. For more than two centuries, those three beautiful words have been the world standard for quality, craftsmanship and excellence, and they still are today.
As President, one of my highest priorities is to restore American manufacturing. For decades, American jobs have been ripped out of our communities. Industries and towns have been stripped bare, and the entire communities have been uprooted and left. Foreign nations got rich at America's expense, and many special interests profited from this great global theft of American wealth.
Since taking the oath of office, our government has adopted a new philosophy: America first, and believe me, it's about time. The era of economic surrender is over, and a new national pride is sweeping across our land. You see it. I see it. We all see it.
Industry confidence has soared to the highest level ever recorded. One of my first acts was ordering all federal agencies to enforce two simple rules: buy American and hire American.
We want to build with American workers, and with American iron, aluminum and steel. We're also tearing down every possible barrier to domestic energy production, to unleash the full power of our economy. The American people will finally be allowed to tap into the vast energy wealth sitting right beneath our feet or right below our shores.
We have also sent a clear message to the world, that we will not allow other nations to take advantage of us any longer. That's why I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord, and believe me it was one-sided. Not a good deal for our country, and the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
And that's why we are pursuing a total renegotiation of NAFTA, and if we don't get it, we will terminate, that is, end NAFTA forever. Every other nation on Earth protects its own interests. America is finally going to do the same, and as we continue to fight for American workers and industry, it won't be long before we see the Made in America label proudly displayed on thousands of new products all across this great land and exported all around the world.
Thank you, God bless you, God bless America. We're all doing a job. We're working very hard. It will be America first. It will be make America great again. It's happening."
2017-07-06,"Speech: Donald Trump Delivers a Speech in Krasiski Square in Warsaw, Poland",Poland,"[19.145136, 51.919438]",donald-trump-speech-warsaw-poland-july-6-2017,"Hello, Poland! Thank you very much. My husband and I have enjoyed visiting your beautiful country. I want to thank President and Mrs. Duda for the warm welcome and their generous hospitality. I had the opportunity to visit the Copernicus Science Centre today, and found it not only informative but thoughtful, its mission, which is to inspire people to observe, experiment, ask questions, and seek answers.
I can think of no better purpose for such a wonderful science center. Thank you to all who were involved in giving us the tour, especially the children who made it such a wonderful experience.
As many of you know, a main focus of my husband's presidency is safety and security of the American people. I think all of us can agree people should be able to live their lives without fear, no matter what country they live in. That is my wish for all of us around the world. [Applause] Thank you again for this wonderful welcome to your very special country. Your kindness and gracious hospitality will not be forgotten. [Applause]
And now it is my honor to introduce to you my husband, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [Applause]
Thank you very much. That's so nice. The United States has many great diplomats, but there is truly no better ambassador for our country than our beautiful First Lady, Melania. Thank you, Melania. That was very nice. [Applause] We've come to your nation to deliver a very important message: America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people. [Applause] Thank you.
The Poles have not only greatly enriched this region, but Polish-Americans have also greatly enriched the United States, and I was truly proud to have their support in the 2016 election. [Applause]
It is a profound honor to stand in this city, by this monument to the Warsaw Uprising, and to address the Polish nation that so many generations have dreamed of: a Poland that is safe, strong, and free. [Applause]
President Duda and your wonderful First Lady, Agata, have welcomed us with the tremendous warmth and kindness for which Poland is known around the world. Thank you. [Applause] My sincere -- and I mean sincerely thank both of them. And to Prime Minister Syzdlo, a very special thanks also. [Applause]
We are also pleased that former President Leck Walesa, so famous for leading the Solidarity Movement, has joined us today, also. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. On behalf of all Americans, let me also thank the entire Polish people for the generosity you have shown in welcoming our soldiers to your country. These soldiers are not only brave defenders of freedom, but also symbols of America's commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic Europe.
We are proudly joined on stage by American, Polish, British, and Romanian soldiers. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Great job. President Duda and I have just come from an incredibly successful meeting with the leaders participating in the Three Seas Initiative. To the citizens of this great region, America is eager to expand our partnership with you. We welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce as you grow your economies. And we are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy. [Applause]
Mr. President, I congratulate you, along with the President of Croatia, on your leadership of this historic Three Seas Initiative. Thank you. [Applause] This is my first visit to Central Europe as President, and I am thrilled that it could be right here at this magnificent, beautiful piece of land. It is beautiful. [Applause] Poland is the geographic heart of Europe, but more importantly, in the Polish people, we see the soul of Europe. Your nation is great because your spirit is great and your spirit is strong. [Applause]
For two centuries, Poland suffered constant and brutal attacks. But while Poland could be invaded and occupied, and its borders even erased from the map, it could never be erased from history or from your hearts. In those dark days, you have lost your land but you never lost your pride. [Applause]
So it is with true admiration that I can say today, that from the farms and villages of your countryside to the cathedrals and squares of your great cities, Poland lives, Poland prospers, and Poland prevails. [Applause]
Despite every effort to transform you, oppress you, or destroy you, you endured and overcame. You are the proud nation of Copernicus -- think of that -- [Applause] -- Chopin, Saint John Paul II. Poland is a land of great heroes. [Applause] And you are a people who know the true value of what you defend. The triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war.
For Americans, Poland has been a symbol of hope since the beginning of our nation. Polish heroes and American patriots fought side by side in our War of Independence and in many wars that followed. Our soldiers still serve together today in Afghanistan and Iraq, combatting the enemies of all civilization.
For America's part, we have never given up on freedom and independence as the right and destiny of the Polish people, and we never, ever will. [Applause] Our two countries share a special bond forged by unique histories and national characters. It's a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and bled and died for freedom. [Applause]
The signs of this friendship stand in our nation's capital. Just steps from the White House, we've raised statues of men with names like Pu_aski and Ko_ciuszko. [Applause] The same is true in Warsaw, where street signs carry the name of George Washington, and a monument stands to one of the world's greatest heroes, Ronald Reagan. [Applause]
And so I am here today not just to visit an old ally, but to hold it up as an example for others who seek freedom and who wish to summon the courage and the will to defend our civilization. [Applause] The story of Poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never, ever forgotten who they are. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump""]
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Such a great honor. This is a nation more than one thousand years old. Your borders were erased for more than a century and only restored just one century ago.
In 1920, in the Miracle of Vistula, Poland stopped the Soviet army bent on European conquest. [Applause] Then, 19 years later in 1939, you were invaded yet again, this time by Nazi Germany from the west and the Soviet Union from the east. That's trouble. That's tough.
Under a double occupation the Polish people endured evils beyond description: the Katyn forest massacre, the occupations, the Holocaust, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the destruction of this beautiful capital city, and the deaths of nearly one in five Polish people. A vibrant Jewish population -- the largest in Europe -- was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland's Jewish citizens, along with countless others, during that brutal occupation.
In the summer of 1944, the Nazi and Soviet armies were preparing for a terrible and bloody battle right here in Warsaw. Amid that hell on earth, the citizens of Poland rose up to defend their homeland. I am deeply honored to be joined on stage today by veterans and heroes of the Warsaw Uprising. [Applause]
What great spirit. We salute your noble sacrifice and we pledge to always remember your fight for Poland and for freedom. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] This monument reminds us that more than 150,000 Poles died during that desperate struggle to overthrow oppression.
From the other side of the river, the Soviet armed forces stopped and waited. They watched as the Nazis ruthlessly destroyed the city, viciously murdering men, women, and children. They tried to destroy this nation forever by shattering its will to survive.
But there is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one could destroy. The Polish martyr, Bishop Michael Kozal, said it well: ""More horrifying than a defeat of arms is a collapse of the human spirit.""
Through four decades of communist rule, Poland and the other captive nations of Europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom, your faith, your laws, your history, your identity -- indeed the very essence of your culture and your humanity. Yet, through it all, you never lost that spirit. [Applause] Your oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken. [Applause]
And when the day came on June 2nd, 1979, and one million Poles gathered around Victory Square for their very first mass with their Polish Pope, that day, every communist in Warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon come crashing down. [Applause] They must have known it at the exact moment during Pope John Paul II's sermon when a million Polish men, women, and children suddenly raised their voices in a single prayer. A million Polish people did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words: ""We Want God."" [Applause]
In those words, the Polish people recalled the promise of a better future. They found new courage to face down their oppressors, and they found the words to declare that Poland would be Poland once again.
As I stand here today before this incredible crowd, this faithful nation, we can still hear those voices that echo through history. Their message is as true today as ever. The people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out ""We want God."" [Applause]
Together, with Pope John Paul II, the Poles reasserted their identity as a nation devoted to God. And with that powerful declaration of who you are, you came to understand what to do and how to live. You stood in solidarity against oppression, against a lawless secret police, against a cruel and wicked system that impoverished your cities and your souls. And you won. Poland prevailed. Poland will always prevail. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump]
Thank you. You were supported in that victory over communism by a strong alliance of free nations in the West that defied tyranny. Now, among the most committed members of the NATO Alliance, Poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a Europe that is strong, whole, and free.
A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and they know that. A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world. [Applause] One hundred years after the entry of American forces into World War I, the transatlantic bond between the United States and Europe is as strong as ever and maybe, in many ways, even stronger.
This continent no longer confronts the specter of communism. But today we're in the West, and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life. You see what's happening out there. They are threats. We will confront them. We will win. But they are threats. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump""]
We are confronted by another oppressive ideology -- one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe. America and Europe have suffered one terror attack after another. We're going to get it to stop. [Applause]
During a historic gathering in Saudi Arabia, I called on the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations to join together to drive out this menace which threatens all of humanity. We must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory and their funding, and their networks, and any form of ideological support that they may have. While we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump""]
We are fighting hard against radical Islamic terrorism, and we will prevail. We cannot accept those who reject our values and who use hatred to justify violence against the innocent.
Today, the West is also confronted by the powers that seek to test our will, undermine our confidence, and challenge our interests. To meet new forms of aggression, including propaganda, financial crimes, and cyberwarfare, we must adapt our alliance to compete effectively in new ways and on all new battlefields.
We urge Russia to cease its destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, and its support for hostile regimes -- including Syria and Iran -- and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself. [Applause]
Finally, on both sides of the Atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger -- one firmly within our control. This danger is invisible to some but familiar to the Poles: the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people. The West became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.
Americans, Poles, and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty. We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are. [Applause] If left unchecked, these forces will undermine our courage, sap our spirit, and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies.
But just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in Poland, we know that these forces, too, are doomed to fail if we want them to fail. And we do, indeed, want them to fail. [Applause] They are doomed not only because our alliance is strong, our countries are resilient, and our power is unmatched. Through all of that, you have to say everything is true. Our adversaries, however, are doomed because we will never forget who we are. And if we don't forget who are, we just can't be beaten
Americans will never forget. The nations of Europe will never forget. We are the fastest and the greatest community. There is nothing like our community of nations. The world has never known anything like our community of nations.
We write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. We reward brilliance. We strive for excellence, and cherish inspiring works of art that honor God. We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression. [Applause]
We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success. We put faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives. And we debate everything. We challenge everything. We seek to know everything so that we can better know ourselves. [Applause]
And above all, we value the dignity of every human life, protect the rights of every person, and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom. That is who we are. Those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization.
What we have, what we inherited from our -- and you know this better than anybody, and you see it today with this incredible group of people -- what we've inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before. And if we fail to preserve it, it will never, ever exist again. So we cannot fail.
This great community of nations has something else in common: In every one of them, it is the people, not the powerful, who have always formed the foundation of freedom and the cornerstone of our defense. The people have been that foundation here in Poland -- as they were right here in Warsaw -- and they were the foundation from the very, very beginning in America.
Our citizens did not win freedom together, did not survive horrors together, did not face down evil together, only to lose our freedom to a lack of pride and confidence in our values. We did not and we will not. We will never back down. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump""]
As long as we know our history, we will know how to build our future. Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests. That is why my administration has demanded that all members of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation.
As a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into NATO. In fact, people are shocked. But billions and billions of dollars more are coming in from countries that, in my opinion, would not have been paying so quickly.
To those who would criticize our tough stance, I would point out that the United States has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind Article 5, the mutual defense commitment. [Applause]
Words are easy, but actions are what matters. And for its own protection -- and you know this, everybody knows this, everybody has to know this -- Europe must do more. Europe must demonstrate that it believes in its future by investing its money to secure that future.
That is why we applaud Poland for its decision to move forward this week on acquiring from the United States the battle-tested Patriot air and missile defense system -- the best anywhere in the world. [Applause] That is also why we salute the Polish people for being one of the NATO countries that has actually achieved the benchmark for investment in our common defense. Thank you. Thank you, Poland. I must tell you, the example you set is truly magnificent, and we applaud Poland. Thank you. [Applause]
We have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will. Because as the Polish experience reminds us, the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have. The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.
Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it? [Applause]
We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on Earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive. [Applause] If anyone forgets the critical importance of these things, let them come to one country that never has. Let them come to Poland. [Applause] And let them come here, to Warsaw, and learn the story of the Warsaw Uprising.
When they do, they should learn about Jerusalem Avenue. In August of 1944, Jerusalem Avenue was one of the main roads running east and west through this city, just as it is today.
Control of that road was crucially important to both sides in the battle for Warsaw. The German military wanted it as their most direct route to move troops and to form a very strong front. And for the Polish Home Army, the ability to pass north and south across that street was critical to keep the center of the city, and the Uprising itself, from being split apart and destroyed.
Every night, the Poles put up sandbags amid machine gun fire -- and it was horrendous fire -- to protect a narrow passage across Jerusalem Avenue. Every day, the enemy forces knocked them down again and again and again. Then the Poles dug a trench. Finally, they built a barricade. And the brave Polish fighters began to flow across Jerusalem Avenue. That narrow passageway, just a few feet wide, was the fragile link that kept the Uprising alive.
Between its walls, a constant stream of citizens and freedom fighters made their perilous, just perilous, sprints. They ran across that street, they ran through that street, they ran under that street -- all to defend this city. ""The far side was several yards away,"" recalled one young Polish woman named Greta. That mortality and that life was so important to her. In fact, she said, ""The mortally dangerous sector of the street was soaked in the blood. It was the blood of messengers, liaison girls, and couriers.""
Nazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed. Anybody who crossed, they were being shot at. Their soldiers burned every building on the street, and they used the Poles as human shields for their tanks in their effort to capture Jerusalem Avenue. The enemy never ceased its relentless assault on that small outpost of civilization. And the Poles never ceased its defense.
The Jerusalem Avenue passage required constant protection, repair, and reinforcement, but the will of its defenders did not waver, even in the face of death. And to the last days of the Uprising, the fragile crossing never, ever failed. It was never, ever forgotten. It was kept open by the Polish people.
The memories of those who perished in the Warsaw Uprising cry out across the decades, and few are clearer than the memories of those who died to build and defend the Jerusalem Avenue crossing. Those heroes remind us that the West was saved with the blood of patriots; that each generation must rise up and play their part in its defense -- [Applause] -- and that every foot of ground, and every last inch of civilization, is worth defending with your life.
Our own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield -- it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls. Today, the ties that unite our civilization are no less vital, and demand no less defense, than that bare shred of land on which the hope of Poland once totally rested. Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory.
And today as ever, Poland is in our heart, and its people are in that fight. [Applause] Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive. And our civilization will triumph. [Applause, chanting ""Donald Trump""]
Thank you. So, together, let us all fight like the Poles -- for family, for freedom, for country, and for God. Thank you. God Bless You. God bless the Polish people. God bless our allies. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you very much. [Applause]"

Robert, thank you very much for that incredible introduction, and thank you to everyone from First Baptist Dallas. Thank You. Pastor, you and Amy have stood with us since the very very beginning, and I will always stand with you. I've told you that, and I mean that I will always be with you. I appreciate it, thank you.
And I'm honored to join you at the first ever Fourth of July Freedom Rally, taking place here at the Kennedy Center, as we pay tribute to those who have proudly served our nation in uniform. Thank you very much. [Applause]
Tonight, we have been inspired by music that fills our heart, stirs our souls, and reminds us all of who we are: one nation, under God. [Applause] To First Baptist music director, Doran Bugg, and to every musician and member of the choir who has performed with such incredible grace and skill -- and I heard them backstage, I said let me out there that is the most beautiful music. I just want to say that your music honors our heroes more eloquently than words could ever do, and I just want to thank you.
That's real talent standing behind me, thank you folks. [Applause] And let me say to the hundreds of veterans with us tonight that for my very first Independence Day celebration as President, there is no place I'd rather be than with you, tell you that. [Applause]
And I promise you -- then you see it happening day by day -- just the other day, we signed veterans accountability, they've been trying to do it for 40 years. [Applause] For 40 years, they've been trying. You couldn't fire somebody, if they were horrible, doing a terrible job for the veterans -- robbing, stealing, hurting people, you couldn't do anything. It's called the Veterans Accountability Act, and now you can say, you're fired.
Thank you, and I promise you that we will always take care of our great veterans, always. Right, Louie? You better believe it. And Paula's up there. Paula White has been so helpful. You've [Audience member yells I Love You] -- thank you I love you too, actually.
You've shed your blood, you've poured your love, and you've bared your soul in defense of our country, our people, and our great American flag. Your loyalty to our nation is measured not merely in words but in deeds. You race through gunfire, stare down enemy forces and ran past the gates of hell to fight and to win for America, and you won for America, and we're going to take care of it. [Applause]
The story of America's men and women in uniform is the story of freedom, and overcoming oppression. The strong protecting the weak, and the good defeating evil. There's a lot of evil out there. I want to tell you there's a lot of evil. I was left a mess, the fact is, but we're cleaning it up. You watch. Cleaning it up. Cleaning it up.
We are awed by your service and your sacrifice, and so to the veterans here tonight, of which there are many, will you please stand, right now? Please stand, thank you. [Applause] On behalf of our very grateful nation, thank you very much. Thank you very much. We will always, always remember what you did for us. Tonight, we celebrate veterans. We also reflect on everything we cherish as Americans. We love our country. We love our families. We love our freedom, and we love our God. [Applause]
Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that Liberty comes from our Creator, our rights are given to us by God and no earthly force can ever take those rights away. [Applause] That is why my administration is transferring power out of Washington and returning that power back to where it belongs -- to the people. To the people.
The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them, because the people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm President and they're not. [Applause] We won, and they lost. The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they use the hatchet and the people saw it right from the beginning.
The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives. On behalf of our great American people, will never happen. Their agenda is not your agenda. You've been saying it. I will never stop fighting for you. I am delivering on trade, on the economy, on the Supreme Court, on the Second Amendment, on our military. For our veterans and on our borders, where we are doing record, record stoppage. [Applause]
Thank you, and we are supporting our incredible police and law enforcement. [Applause] We will save American lives, protect American sovereignty, and we will ensure the forgotten men and women of our country are never forgotten again.
For too long, politicians have tried... all have they tried, to centralize authority among the hands of a small few in our nation's capital. I see them all the time. Bureaucrats think they can run over your lives, overrule your values, meddle in your faith and tell you how to live, what to say and where to pray. But we know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children and create a thriving Society. [Applause]
And we know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community. And above all else, we know this: in America, we don't worship government. We worship God. [Applause] Our religious liberty is enshrined in the very First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. The American founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer.
I remind you that we're going to start saying Merry Christmas again. [Applause] True. Inscribed on our currency are the words In God We Trust. But not only has God bestowed on us the gift of freedom, he's also given us the gift of heroes willing to give their lives to defend that freedom. You just stood in every struggle against evil throughout our history, as America's service members have huddled around campfire,  and sought refuge in foxholes.
They've called on their Creator for support in World War II when General George Patton -- that was a real general, we got some Pattons today too, I found them. Mad Dog Mattis. [Applause] And he doesn't like doing a lot of talking, but I want to tell you ISIS, the whole different ball game, folks. They're going fast.
But when Patton ran into a problem that he couldn't solve, he knew what to do. He prayed. Frustrated by rains that were stalling the advance of his Third Army across Europe in early December 1944, horrible weather, Patton asked an Army chaplain to come up with a good prayer for the weather.
Patton then had a quarter of a million copies of that prayer printed and distributed to the soldiers of the Third Army, just before the Battle of the Bulge. That was a big one, did very well there. Five hundred thousand American soldiers fought that pivotal battle of the Second World War. One of those soldiers is here with us tonight. His name is Harry F Miller, where's Harry? Where's Harry? Harry, stand up Harry. [Applause]
Like many of the heroes of his generation, Harry wasn't exactly straightforward about his age when he enlisted in the Army Reserves. Shame on you. Harry, he was just 15 but he told them he was old enough to join. Then he immediately asked for a transfer to active duty six months after he had enlisted. Private Miller was on his way to Europe to fight for our country. [Applause]
A couple of months after that, he was in the freezing cold. How cold? Cold, he said. Really cold and driving rain of Belgium with the 740th Tank Battalion attached to the 82nd airborne, as the Battle of the Bulge began. Harry got his orders to go find tanks at a weapon storage facility. When he arrived, he says he and his friends found nothing but tanks they were all over the place, right? Nothing but tanks.
But they didn't let the tanks stop them. Out of what spare parts they could find, and through sheer grit and resolve, they somehow managed to repair three of those tanks and get them all set for action and ready to fight.
And before long ,those three tanks were nose-to-nose with the lead elements of a German SS Panzer Division, and that was tough stuff. In a short time, those tanks had knocked out the first three tanks of the enemy, and the entire German division retreated. They left. That's good, Harry. [Applause] That's good, Harry. [Applause] Harry fought through the battle and the rest of the war and he went on to serve our armed forces for 22 years, retiring as a Senior Master Sergeant. A lot of guts.
Tomorrow, Harry will be 89. Tomorrow. So on behalf of this very large group, in this beautiful building, Senior Master Sergeant Miller, Happy Birthday. Thank you for your lifetime of service, and thank you for helping out. Thank you very much. [Applause] Every veteran with us tonight, from every branch of the military -- Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard, I want you to know that we will always keep our promises to those who have kept us free.
Since my very first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve. We've published wait times -- those wait times were bad, weren't they? But boy, are they getting better and fast. And we've published them at every VA facility, delivered same day mental health services at every VA Medical Center, nearly doubled. [Applause]
The number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice, and as I said, just signed, brand-new legislation went through the House, went through the Senate and I signed it so fast. We didn't want to take any chances, right Harry? To ensure every VA worker is held accountable for the quality of care they provide to our veterans. [Applause]
Tonight, we are deeply honored to be joined by a number of wounded warriors from Walter Reed. I was over there recently. These are incredible people, the enthusiasm and the spirit and some of them were hurt really badly. They've got so much spirit and they love this country so much. These American heroes risked everything so that you and I can live in freedom. They gave all. They had everything for their comrades, their country and for victory.
They liked winning. We like winning again, don't we? [Applause] You know, the old days, we used to win. We sort of just keep fighting and fighting and fighting. Gonna win again, folks. We applaud their strength, their courage and we really support that incredible wind that they have. The will, the will is so strong and that's what they want to do, is they want to win, and they want to win for you. So thank you all very much for being here, that was great. [Applause]
One such hero is Captain Luis Avila, where is he Luis? Luis? [Applause] Ee love you Luis. [Applause] The ways... Wow! [Applause] Luis is here tonight along with his wife Claudia. Thank You Claudia. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Thank you. Luis served in the Army for 16 years. He held many different positions on five combat tours, and he was always a leader, and everybody always said. I did some checking on you Luis, that you did a great job no matter where you were. No matter where you went.
On his fifth deployment, Luis bravely led his company on a successful mission to recover vital intelligence. During this critical mission, his vehicle was struck by explosives. Luis was gravely wounded, and lost his leg. He received a Purple Heart for service and sacrifice. To Luis and Claudia, we will never forget the courageous sacrifice that you made for all of us in this room tonight, and for everyone in our country. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
I want you all, and all of our incredible wounded warriors, to know you have an entire nation of more than 300 million people behind you, and our nation's getting strong again. You notice getting strong again. Our hearts and our prayers are joined with yours. Your legacy, like our gratitude, will live forever, and I want to thank you.
Thank you very much, and Claudia thank you very much. Thank you. I also want to speak to all of the people -- see you thought I forgot -- in our faith community, who are here with us tonight. Veterans and non-veterans alike, you're never gonna be forgotten. You'll never be forgotten. My administration will always support and defend your religious liberty. [Applause] We don't want to see God forced out of the public square, driven out of our schools, or pushed out of our civic life. We want to see prayers before football games, if they want to give prayers.
We want all children to have the opportunity to know the blessings of God. We will not allow the government to censor sermons, to restrict the free speech of our pastors and our preachers, and the people that we most respect, like Robert. That is why... just as I promised Pastor Jeffress and other faith leaders... I just signed an executive order following, and this is something that makes me very happy and very proud, following through on my campaign pledge to stop the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights.
As long as I am President, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart. We want to hear him. One of the most grave and dire threats to religious freedom in the world today is the threat of terrorism, and specifically, it just seems, it's called radical Islamic terrorism, and we cannot allow this terrorism and extremism to spread in our country or to find sanctuary on our shores or in our cities.
We want to make sure that anyone who seeks to join our country shares our values and has the capacity to love our people. [Applause] Thank you. Together, we will protect our families, our nations and our borders and yes, by the way for those that are curious, we will build the wall, okay? Because we understand that a country is more than just its geography. A nation is the sum of its citizens, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations.
America is a land rich with history traditions and values, and as we have seen tonight, what a group this is tonight. America is also a land rich with heroes. [Applause] And though we have many stories, we all share one home and one glorious destiny, a destiny that's getting better and better. Every single day, and whether we are black or brown or white, and you've heard me say this before, we all bleed the same red blood. We all salute the same great American flag, and we are all made by the same Almighty God. [Applause]
We face many challenges. There are many hills and mountains to climb, but with the strength and courage of the Patriots assembled in this room tonight, we will scale -- I mean, and you say it, and you see it all the time, and we're doing it all the time, because we're scaling those summits, and we will get the job done. We will all prove worthy of this very important moment in history, and we will prove worthy of the sacrifice that our brave veterans have made. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, we will not fail. [Applause]
As long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its heroesm and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come. Because we will make America great again. [Applause] Thank you. To my friend Pastor Jeffress, and to Paula and to Louie  and to Harry and to Luis, and everybody in this room, and everybody in this country, thank you for your great support. I appreciate it.
I will not let you down -- all of our incredible veterans -- the people in the military and -- evangelical Christians who came out in record, record, record numbers. Thank you. Have a wonderful Independence Day. God bless you. God bless our nation's veterans. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
2017-06-30,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-june-30-2017,"My fellow Americans, This week, I was joined at the White House by American families whose loved ones were killed by illegal immigrants. Many of these illegal immigrants had extensive criminal records and had been repeatedly deported. Every single one of these deaths was preventable.
These beautiful American lives were stolen because our government refused to do its job. If the government had simply enforced our immigration laws, these Americans would still be alive today. That is why, since the day I took the oath of office, I have been restoring the enforcement of our immigration laws and the protection and defense of our borders.
These courageous Americans joined me at the White House to call on Congress to pass two bills that I campaigned on during the election. If enacted, these bills will save countless Americans lives. The first bill, Kate's Law, is named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly re-enter our country illegally.
The second bill, the No Sanctuary For Criminals Act, will block federal grants to jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement. On Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security.
I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank Leadership for advancing these life-saving measures.
I now call on the Senate to take up these bills and send them back to my desk for signature Ã as soon as possible. We need security. We need safety in our country. And I call on members of both parties to stand united with victims to stop these terrible and senseless crimes from ever happening in the first place.
This legislation presents a simple choice: either vote to save and protect American lives, or vote to shield and comfort criminal aliens who threaten innocent lives Ã and they've been shielded too long.
As we head towards the Fourth of July, we remember now more than ever to cherish our freedom. The foundation of freedom is the rule of law. It forms the bedrock of our Constitution and the cornerstone of our way of life.
So this Independence Day, while we're enjoying treasured time with our friends and loved ones, let us not forget the families who have an empty seat at the table this year. And let us pledge that from now on, we will protect, defend and save American lives. Thank you."
2017-06-23,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-june-23-2017,"My fellow Americans, Millions of families across our nation are suffering under the disaster known as Obamacare. Traveling throughout our country over the last two years, I have met so many of these wonderful Americans, and I have never forgotten their stories.
In Wisconsin, I recently met a proud Veteran and his wife Ã Michael and Tammy Kushman. When they were forced onto Obamacare and the exchange in 2015, they thought they would be able to keep their doctor-but they couldn't.
They thought they would be able to keep their plan Ã but they weren't allowed. They were told their premiums would go down Ã but instead, they soared by 120 percent upward. It was one Obamacare lie after another. Today, the Kushmans spend $1,400 dollars a month on health insurance Ã nearly one-fourth of their entire net monthly income.
On the same visit, I met another family, Robert and Sarah Stoll. Robert is a volunteer captain for his local fire department. After their Obamacare premiums nearly doubled, they needed extra money and Sarah had no choice but to leave retirement to pay their bills.
But this new income meant they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received, and the federal government actually forced them to repay thousands and thousands of dollars.
These families and so many others are victims of a catastrophic law that is wreaking havoc on our healthcare system and our families.
Democrats in Congress created this calamity and now, if we don't act, millions more Americans will be hurt by Obamacare's deepening death spiral.
Americans were promised lower premiums, more choices, and better access. Instead, premiums have doubled nationwide Ã and insurers are still fleeing the market that Obamacare has nearly destroyed.
Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges Ã and many markets may soon have no insurers at all. It really is a disaster.
The American people are calling out for relief, and my administration is determined to provide it Ã and we are working with Congress to get a bill to my desk so we can rescue Americans from this catastrophe.
As families across the nation continue to suffer under this law, I only hope that Democrats in Congress will have the political courage to help fix what we know to be a catastrophic situation Ã a total disaster Ã that they have created
To be part of the solution, instead of obstructing Ã always obstructing Ã change, blocking reform, and doubling-down on Obamacare's failure.
But no matter what, my Administration will never stop fighting for you Ã and for the healthcare system that you deserve. We'll get it done. Even if we don't have any help from the Democrats, we'll get it done. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-06-21,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses Agricultural Innovation,"Cedar Rapids, IA, United States","[-91.6656232, 41.9778795]",donald-trump-speech-agriculture-cedar-rapids-iowa-june-21-2017,"Thank you very much. I just learned more about farming than I ever thought I'd learn. What a good place. I love it. I want to thank also Dean Scott Ermer along with the students and faculty at Kirkwood Community College for hosting us.
What a beautiful place. We're here today to talk about how we're going to empower America's farmers and protect our nation's proud farming legacy, including ethanol, which I've done. [Applause] Family farmers are the backbone of America, and my administration will always support the farmer.
I want to begin by congratulating Iowa's new governor, Kim Reynolds. Where's Kim? [Applause] I'm so proud of Kim. I've known Kim for a long time, and her husband. And I said, you know, one of the other things I get with Terry, by moving him out, Kim becomes governor and Terry can take on China. [Applause] That's not bad. She is doing a great job.
Thanks also to Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg -- [Applause] -- and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, a man who's been to so many of my stops, Bill Northey. [Applause] Thank you, Bill. Thank you for all that support. And Congressman -- a very popular guy -- Rod Blum, doing a fantastic job in Washington. [Applause]
All right, so, most importantly, I have to say -- they will all agree -- he's a great friend of mine, with an incredible family, a very talented son, Eric -- that I can tell you -- but I'm really, truly proud. I wanted to be here for this reason -- to congratulate your former governor, our new ambassador to China, Terry Branstad. [Applause]
Terry is a true legend. The people of Iowa first made him governor in 1983. You elected him six times and made him the longest-serving governor of any state in the history of America. That's not bad. [Applause]
Under Terry, Iowa's economy is stronger, its farmers more successful, its schools better, its communities more prosperous, and its citizens safer. And I want to tell you that's three decades. This is one great man.
He's been in politics for more than three decades. And we're going to keep him there -- I don't know, do we consider ambassadors politicians? Not really, in the true sense. So perhaps we sort pulled you out. But he's going to be a doing a job.
I'll tell you one quick story with Terry. When I was campaigning in Iowa, Terry would always say, ""Do me favor -- don't say anything bad about China."" [Laughter]
See, in that day -- in those days, he didn't call me ""Mr. President"" -- he'd say ""Donald."" He'd say, ""Donald, don't say anything bad about China."" I said, why? He said, ""We have a great relationship with China, and I like it, and I really like President Xi,"" who he knew for 30-some-odd years.
And it really dawned on me when I was thinking about ambassadors. I said, boy, wouldn't it be great if I picked a man that really likes China and, by the way, China really likes him? [Applause]
So that was an easy one. I called him up, and I said, you know, I think after 24 years it's maybe time for a change, so let me just steal you. I also knew about Kim, and Kim has been a great supporter and friend, and so I knew that that was going to be taken care of very nicely. So we're really happy and really proud of Terry.
You know, his legacy will endure for a long, long time in this state. He loves this state and the people so much. And together, we all join to express our deep gratitude to Terry for everything he has done for Iowa and for its people. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much. And have a good time in China. [Applause]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. For a farm kid from Iowa, my life's ambition was to serve the people as governor. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that President Trump would ask me to represent all of the United States of America in China. I will do my very best.
Mr. President, first of all, I want to congratulate you on your leadership. We've been trying to get American beef in China for 13 years, and you've already got it done. [Applause] And there's more to come!
I am honored and proud to represent the United States of America and President Trump in the People's Republic of China. And I hope a lot of you will come to see us. Thank you. [Applause]
Thank you. Great guy. Ambassador Branstad will be serving in Beijing, but he's going to be fighting for American farmers and for American workers and for Americans. And there's nobody I can think of that can do a better job or a more effective job.
So, Terry, go out there. He'll be joining Secretary of Agriculture -- somebody you all know very well -- the legendary, Sonny Perdue -- [Applause] -- and a man who is another legend on Wall Street -- truly a legend; they just call him Wilbur. How about Wall Street? [Applause] Where Wall Street is big and strong, he's just known as Wilbur.
It's Wilbur Ross. Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce. Pretty good on Wall Street. When they just say, ""I hear Wilbur is going to be Secretary of Commerce"" -- Carl Icahn called me. He said, ""Donald, I heard you got Wilbur."" That was it. It wasn't ""Wilbur Ross."" But there's Wilbur Ross, and he's going a fantastic job.
And also working along with Wilbur is U.S. Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, another phenomenal talent. And I told you about fair trade. I told you about free trade.
I told you about trade. We have the best in the world on our side now, finally, after watching for many, many decades what's been happening, with trade deficits that are beyond anything that anybody could imagine -- hundreds of billions of dollars. And now we have the right people on our side.
So, Wilbur, go out and do it. Robert, go out and do it. We'll all have a good time together. And you know what? The world is going to like us even better, believe it or not.
So they're going to be representing -- [Applause] -- they're going to be representing America's interests and delivering historic wins for our farmers and our factory workers, and our workers generally. And I have to tell you, last night was very exciting.
Karen Handel and Ralph -- Ralph Norman. [Applause] Ralph Norman. I spoke to Ralph today. He won a great event. Now, a lot of people didn't show up to vote because they said, well, he's going to win by so much. It got a little bit tighter than he thought. [Laughter]
Sometimes when they think you're going to win by too much, I wouldn't say that's so good. Next time we're going to say it's going to be really close. But he still won easily. But what a fantastic guy he is. And between the two of them, that was a big night.
So we're 5-0 in special elections -- 5-0. [Applause] 5-0. And I watched the faces on those newscasters, in many cases, and they were going, oh, this is going to be a big night; this will be great humiliation for President Trump if she doesn't make it. Well, they weren't thinking in terms of Ralph so much. In all fairness, Ralph sort of said he felt like the forgotten man last night.
But this will be tremendous humiliation -- they built these studios; they built everything. They were set. Believe me, had our wonderful candidate lost, this would have been one of the great, big stories in the history of American politics.
Those studios would have been up for weeks. They would have been talking for weeks about this tremendous defeat. And after it said projected winner was sort of -- they just sort of slinked out of there. [Laughter] They slinked out.
One of them actually said, well, maybe it was the weather. You know, it was drizzling. A little bit like this, but a little bit less. It was drizzling. Did you hear that one, Ambassador? It was drizzling. Maybe that was the difference.
And won by a lot. Won by a lot. So we're very happy. And she's going to be -- Karen is going to be a great person in Congress. And we have some incredible people and we're doing some really wonderful things, including the taxes are coming along and the healthcare is coming along. [Applause]
And we have Gary Cohn, the President of Goldman Sachs, who left Goldman Sachs and a slightly higher salary than he's getting right now by, like, hundreds of millions of dollars -- like by a lot. [Laughter] Where's Gary? He's around here someplace.
And Gary is working on some incredible plans -- not only taxes, but we're going to be rebuilding our country. We're going to do things in terms of infrastructure that we need. Our roads, our highways, our bridges, our schools, our airports.
We spent, as of a few months ago, $6 trillion -- trillion -- in the Middle East. We have nothing. We're back further than we were 16 years ago when this whole thing started -- $6 trillion. And if you want to spend three and half dollars to build a school, or you want to build -- you want to spend any money in this country, it's like a big deal. But we spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. And we're going to get that whole situation under control.
That's not an easy one. I was dealt a very difficult hand, believe me, when I took over, between North Korea, the Middle East -- you look at Afghanistan, what's going on there. This was a tough hand. But you put me there for a reason, and I think you're going to be very happy with the end result, believe me. [Applause]
American farmers and ranchers are the best -- absolute best at what they do. And they can compete anywhere if they are given a level playing field. They're not given that level playing field because of our terrible, terrible trade deals. And we're going to start doing much better. You produce the product, but you have to work too hard and too long to make a living.
We're cracking down on foreign trading abuses; making it easier to produce and grow in America; eliminating job-killing regulations all over the place -- [Applause] -- and we're training our great American workers.
That's why it's so important to support schools like Kirkwood, which are helping to train young people in cutting-edge new technologies that will make American agriculture greater and more productive than ever before.
Farming -- which is something that is very beautiful to me. I'm not a farmer, but I'd be very happy to be one. It's a very beautiful world to me. And it's a truly noble American profession. Today, we're celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American farmer and the American worker.
George Washington once wrote: ""I'd rather be on my farm than be emperor of the world."" We understand that. Especially after I've spent all this time in Washington, I can really understand. [Laughter]
I want to make sure the next generation of Americans has that opportunity as well. And, in particular, that includes your children and your grandchildren, and working very hard to get rid of the death tax so that those farms can be passed on. [Applause]
Very, very hard to get rid of that. We're working very hard so your farms can be passed on to your children and your grandchildren. And they'll keep them going and they'll run them with love.
We want to eliminate the intrusive rules that undermine your ability to earn a living, and we will protect the corn-based ethanol and biofuels that power our country. [Applause] And you remember, during the campaign, I made that promise.
And I also made a promise, I'm coming back. And here I am. And that promise has been kept. [Applause] And even Terry is clapping about that one, but he was fighting very hard for that, believe me.
For the past two weeks, my administration has been working extensively on vocational education, infrastructure, and technology. Here, at this great facility, we have just seen fantastic examples of how vocational training in new technologies can help make American farming even more productive so we can compete and win, win, win on the world stage.
We saw how today's farmers can adjust application rates of fertilizers in their fields with just the touch of a smartphone. It's changed a lot over the years.
They showed us how they use precision agriculture to produce crops more efficiently and for far less cost. They've demonstrated how drones, of all things, are used to gather data on crops, and how simulators are used to train students in the next generation of farming equipment.
If we continue to train our workers in these new technologies, then we will usher in a new era of prosperity for American agriculture and for the American farming family.
We must also ensure that these students have the broadband Internet access they need in order to succeed and thrive in this new and very modern and very changed economy and world. That is why I will be including a provision in our infrastructure proposal -- $1 trillion proposal -- you'll be seeing it very shortly -- to promote and foster enhanced broadband access for rural America also. [Applause] We know that Wall Street wants it very badly, but you know what else? The farmers also want it. And you're going to have it.
We have to make sure American farmers and their families, wherever they may be, wherever they may go, have the infrastructure projects that they need to compete and grow. And I mean grow against world competition, because that's who you're up against now.
We will rebuild rural America. [Applause] American farmers -- [Applause] -- thank you -- American farmers pour their hearts into their crops and their love into their great communities. That's why they call this the Heartland.
And those maps, those electoral maps, they were all red. Beautiful red. [Laughter] Beautiful. [Applause] If you look at those maps, it's almost like -- wow. A lot places that people weren't thinking about turned red. A couple of little blue dots on the sides, but they are red -- farmers.
And our farmers' work ethic feeds America, and their toughness and grit define America. They're tough and they're smart. [Applause] Our rich and abundant soil provides more than a living; it provides a beautiful way of life for a lot of people.
Today we honor and treasure this noble history, and embrace the new technology that will power this industry well into the future. With incredible leaders and students like all of you, I know that the future of American farming has never looked brighter. Believe me. And with me as your President, it's going to be that way, I will tell you that. [Applause]
So it's a great honor to be here with you today. People that I know, people that I love, very special people; the people of Iowa that were so good to me during the election. So many friends. I want to thank you for being here. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"

It is great to be back in the great state of Iowa... [Applause] ... home of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend Dan Gable, some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.
It's always terrific to be able to leave that Washington swamp... [Applause] ... and spend time... [Applause] ... with the truly hardworking people. We call them American patriots. Amazing people. [Applause] I want to also extend our congratulations this evening to Karen Handel of Georgia. [Applause] And we can't forget Ralph Norman in South Carolina. He called me and I called him... [Applause]
He said, you know, last night I felt like the forgotten man. But he won, and he won really beautifully. Even though most people, a lot of people didn't show up because they thought he was going to win by so much. It's always dangerous to have those big leads. But he won very easily. And he is a terrific guy.
And I'll tell you what, Karen is going to be really incredible. She's going to be joining some wonderful people and doing some wonderful work including major, major tax cuts and health care and lots of things. [Applause]
Going to be reducing crime and we're securing that Second Amendment. I told you about that. And that looks like it's in good shape with Judge Gorsuch. That looks like it's in good shape. [Applause] I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone... [Booing] ... recovering from the assault. [Booing] Never fails. Never fails. [Audience chants USA] And we love our police. We love our police. [Applause]
So, to Steve we say -- and he's a great guy, was in my office the day before, incredible. We're praying for you. We're pulling for you. You have our absolute support and our deepest admiration. [Applause] And our gratitude goes out tonight as well to the Capitol Police officers who saved so many lives. You know, they ran from the outfield and they were being hit by rifle fire.
They only had handguns. And they were able to get him. It was an amazing show of talent and bravery. [Applause] So, we want to thank all of the police officers who so bravely serve and protect us. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hopefully our nation emerges from this ordeal -- it was an ordeal, terrible -- more unified and more determined than ever before. And I can see it. And we are indeed more unified in our own way than ever before
You just have to take a look at what's happening here. Right? [Applause] If we set aside the cynics and the critics, we have a chance, and it's a great chance. It lies before us to do extraordinary things for our country in the years ahead.
History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters. [Applause] So... [Applause] ... while we are here tonight to celebrate the amazing progress that we've already made, and we have made amazing progress... [Applause] ... we're also here to lay out the next steps in our incredible movement to make America great again.
Everyone gathered in this arena is bound together by common values. You love our country. You obey our laws. You honor our traditions. And you care for your families. And you love your communities. [Applause] All you want is a government that shows you the same respect and loyalty in return. You believe that America must protect and defend its own citizens. With that conviction deep in your hearts, you showed up on Election Day, November 8th, and voted to put America first. [Applause]
About time. It's about time. [Applause] And from the moment I took that solemn oath of office and every single day since, that is exactly what I've done, put America first. [Applause] After years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our country. And you see it happening. You see it happening. You see what's going on.
Jobs are just about the best they've ever been. We've created almost $4 trillion in wealth if you look at your stock values and you look at what's going on with our country. But we've created tremendous wealth. The enthusiasm and spirit on every single index is higher than it's ever been before for our manufacturers and for our companies. [Applause] After spending billions of dollars defending other people's borders, we are finally going to defend our borders. [Applause, Chanting USA]
After decades of rebuilding foreign nations all over the world, we are now rebuilding our nation. [Applause] As of a few months ago, our country has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, wasted. And the lives, the lives, thousands and thousands and thousands of lives. $6 trillion and thousands of young, beautiful lives.
We started 16 years ago and it's in far worse shape than it was 16 years ago by many times over. So, we spent all of this money, all of these lives. And let me tell you, I came in and took over a very, very difficult hand. But we're going to get it fixed. That's what you put me here for. We're going to get it fixed. [Applause] We'll get it fixed. Shame. It's a shame. And then you look at North Korea -- thank you. Then you look at your -- and I'm praying for you. Thank you very much.
But you look at North Korea, what's going -- look at Otto, beautiful Otto. Went over there a healthy, wonderful boy and you see how he came back. You see how he came back. So, we've been given a bad hand. But we're going to take that bad hand and it'll all be good.
In addition to that, we're going to start taking care of our country. [Applause] The people are the rulers of this country once again. One by one we are keeping the promises we made to the people of Iowa and the people all over our country. We are not going to let the same failed and tired voices in Washington keep us from delivering the change you voted for and the change that you deserve, that you deserve. [Applause]
I do not answer to any donors or financial contributors. I don't care about them. [Applause] I am not beholden to any consultants or any of the very powerful special interests. I don't care about them. I have to do what's right. And if they're right, that's good. [Applause] We will never be intimidated by the dishonest media corporations who will say anything and do anything [Booing] to get people to watch their screens or to get people to buy their failing papers. [Applause] They are failing.
These entrenched forces are fighting only for themselves, and in many cases for their survival. But I'm fighting for you. I'm fighting for you. [Applause] Fighting for your hopes because your hopes are my hopes. I've had a great time in this country. I've had a great run. And it was time to do something. We all saw what was happening. It was time to do something.
Your dreams are my dreams. And your future is what I'm focused on each and every day. We're going to make America great again. Believe me. We're going to make America great again. [Applause] Here are just some of the historic accomplishments we've achieved in just a very short period of time. And I have to just preface it by saying [Audience shouts We Love You] Thank you, darling.
I have to preface it by saying -- you know, I've been watching. They're saying, President Trump has not produced health care. You know, I've been there for five months. [Laughter] If you remember during the Clinton period, they worked for years and years and years. They never got health care. Obama... [Booing] Although after listening to their testimony I fully understand. But President Obama, his whole administration pushing, pushing for Obamacare, which has now failed.
In fact, I was just told by your great governor and ex-governor that your insurance companies have all fled the state of Iowa. Pretty sad, isn't it? Well, they're -- I'll tell you what, they're going from every state. They're leaving all of the states.
Obamacare is a disaster. It's over. And there's nothing to compare what we're doing. I think, I hope -- I hope the Republican Senate -- if we went and got the single greatest health care plan in the history of the world, we would not get one Democrat vote because they're obstructionists. They're obstructionists. [Booing]
We wouldn't get one Democrat... [Applause] If we came to you and said here's your plan. You're going to have the greatest plan in history and you're going to pay nothing, they'd vote against it, folks. [Laughter]
Every, single vote. So, we have a very slim 52 to 48. That means we basically can't lose anybody. And I think and I hope, can't guarantee anything, but I hope we're going to surprise you with a really good plan.
You know, I've been talking about a plan with heart. I said, add some money to it, a plan with heart. But Obamacare is dead. But it is interesting how they say, Donald Trump is not producing health care, not producing. So, we've produced so much -- I don't think any president, it could be somebody, I have to be a little careful because they'll say, he lied. [Laughter] So, few presidents, few -- just have to be a little careful because they'll say, headline: Donald Trump lies to the people of Iowa.
I don't want... [Laughter] But very few have done what we've done when you look at the regulations, when you look at all of -- you know, they were saying, but he didn't pass legislative bills. I think it's 38. And we're going to be talking about them, 38. And if you listen to them... [Applause] Thirty-eight. But, but, but... [Applause] And some of them are really big, having to do with regulation, having to do with lots of different things.
But, we're working really hard on massive tax cuts. It would be, if I get it the way I want it, the largest tax cut in the history of the United States of America. [Applause] Because... right now, we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world. Really on a large-scale basis, we are the highest tax nation in the world. And we're going to get it down really low, OK? Really -- I don't say the lowest because there are a couple that are really down there. But that doesn't mean you want to be there.
But we're going to have one of the lowest taxes from the highest tax. And we're working hard on it. And I think it's going to happen. And I tell you, I think health care's going to happen. And infrastructure's going to happen. You're going to have a lot of exciting things over the next few months. And I look forward to being able to produce it. Let's see what happens. [Applause] And... [Applause] And by the way, if we had even a little Democrat support, just a little like a couple of votes, you'd have everything.
And you could give us a lot of votes and we'd even be willing to change it and move it around and try and make it even better. It's going to have good heart, but even better. But again, they just want to stop. They just want to obstruct. A few votes... [Booing] Seriously. A few votes from the Democrats, it could be so easy and so beautiful and you'd have cooperation.
And their plan isn't working because they thought they were going to win last night in Atlanta. They thought they were going to win. [Applause] And they've been unbelievably nasty, really nasty. And they thought -- they spent close to $30 million on this kid who forgot to live in the community that he was in.
I mean, you know. [Laughter] Look, I'll tell you about the Democrats. I am making it a little bit hard to get their support, but who cares? [Laughter] I'll tell you about the Democrats. They raised a fortune for him. They fought like hell. They said they were going to win. All of the television networks, other than Fox, which really has treated us fairly, by the way. [Applause]
They have. [Applause] But they built these studios, CNN... [Booing] Hey. Their camera just went off. I can't imagine. [Laughter] It's covered live. Their camera just went off. I can't imagine why.
This phony -- this phony NBC television network. [Booing] They actually had one of the people say, you know, it was a little rainy last night. Maybe that was the difference in Karen's race. Can you believe that?
But, but they had these beautiful studios. And if Karen Handel had lost, they would've blamed it on me, which is fine. But if she had lost, they would've been there for weeks talking about this. This would've been the greatest defeat in the history of American politics.
When she won, when they said projected winner is Karen Handel. Then they said, we switch to another program. Right? So... [Laughter] It was so short. They couldn't get out of there fast enough.
And don't forget, this happened in Montana. Right? In Kansas... [Applause] Last night South Carolina with Ralph, who was expected to win and he won. California. So. But it's been -- it's been incredible.
So, we're 5 and 0. We're 5 and 0. And... [Applause] And they thought they were going to win at least like three, right, wouldn't you say? At least three. And it would be a devastating defeat.
The truth us, people love us, all of us. They love us. [Applause] They don't get it. They haven't figured it out yet. You know, they're still trying to figure where all of those voters came from. Those voters came out of the hills. They came -- these are hardworking -- we have the hardest working, the smartest people, the toughest people.
They're very lucky that our people don't protest, believe me. Believe me. [Applause] They're very lucky. [Applause, chanting USA] We have them. We have the smart ones. We have the toughest ones. Great, great Americans.
And Hillary said the deplorables. These are just the opposite, believe me, of the deplorables. These are just the opposite. [Applause] We have a group, Bikers for Trump. You ever seen? They come by the thousands. Oh. [Applause] Oh. My man. Look. How are you?
We have the -- I didn't know you were here. They're here. Now we know we're protected. That's great. Good to have you, man. These are great people. And when I see them, I say, now we're safe. And they like Trump. And I guess we're well into the 90s. What do you think? The 90s, 95s. But we love our people. And they love us. And more importantly, they love our policy. They love what we're doing.
You see what we're doing. You see what we've already done. Homebuilders are starting to build again. We're not confiscating their land with ridiculous rules and regulations that don't make sense. Farmers are able to plow their field. [Applause] If they have a puddle in the middle of their field, a little puddle the size of this, it's considered a lake and you can't touch it.
And if you touch it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family. We got rid of that one too, OK? [Applause] Unemployment is at a 16-year low. And manufacturing is doing phenomenally. And we have companies moving back.
They're coming back, back, back. [Applause] You know, in the state of Michigan, which has just been like an exit pool where car companies have left. I told them, you know what, you want to start leaving, you want to fire all these people? You watch what we're going to be doing. You watch what we're going to be doing. Not going to be too long.
We have the legendary Wall Street genius Wilbur Ross here. He's our secretary of Commerce. [Applause] We have Gary Cohn who's the president of Goldman Sachs. That's somebody. He's the president of Goldman Sachs. He had to pay over $200 million in taxes to take the job, right? So, somebody said, why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? [Laughter]
I said -- no, it's true. And Wilbur's a very rich person in charge of Commerce. I said, because that's the kind of thinking we want. I mean, you know, really. Because they're representing the country. They don't want the money. They're representing the country. [Applause] And they had to give up a lot to take these jobs. They gave up a lot.
When you get the president, this is the president of Goldman Sachs, smart. Having him represent us. He went from massive pay days to peanuts, to little, tiny -- I'm waiting for them to accuse him of wanting that little amount of money. They wanted that.
But these are people that are great, brilliant business minds. And that's what we need. That's what we have to have so the world doesn't take advantage of us. [Applause] We can't have the world taking advantage of us anymore. [Applause] And I love all people, rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it. But I like it better this way, right?
So, we've achieved a historic increase in defense spending. And we've created a new Office of Accountability at the V.A., our veterans, to ensure that our veterans... [Applause] ... get the care that they so richly deserve, our veterans. We've eliminated restrictions on the production of American energy. They wanted to take away our wealth. The world wanted to take away our wealth.
We happened to be lucky. Under our feet we have great wealth. Not only in the form of your kind of wealth, which is beautiful, fertile soil, but also in other locations in the form of energy. They wanted to take that power and that wealth away from us.
And we've ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. And we're putting our miners back to work. [Applause] In fact, you read about it, last week a brand, new coal mine just opened in the state of Pennsylvania, first time in decades, decades. [Applause] We've reversed... [Applause] And 33,000 mining jobs have been added since my inauguration. [Applause]
And again, we're going to have all forms of energy. But coal is something we have a tremendous advantage at. But we're going to have all, whether it's natural gas, whether it's alternative sources. We're going to have everything.
But a power, it's called, it's a power for our electric different plants and for our furnaces. It's a power. We use electric. We use wind. We use solar. We use coal. We use natural gas. We will use nuclear if the right opportunity presents itself.
We're going to be strong for the future. We're going to be strong for the future. I don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes and your factory. [Applause] As the birds fall to the ground. [Laughter] But I like all of them. And that's what we need.
And by the way, we're saving your ethanol industries in the state of Iowa, just like I promised I would do in my campaign. [Applause] And believe me, they are under siege, folks. I don't know if you know it, but they are under siege. We've approved, first day, the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. First thing. Day one. [Applause] Thirty-eight thousand jobs. And better for the environment, by the way, better. Underground. Better for the environment. And safer.
Can you imagine the executive for Keystone, who a year-and-a-half ago was told it's dead? And they had billions invested. They bought half of the pipe. And somebody walks into his office, probably a consultant that charged him tens of millions of dollars. Sir, the pipeline was just approved.
Now, you know what he's going to do. He said, I did a great job, sir. I'm entitled to millions of dollars in consulting fees. It was just Trump approving the pipeline. We approved it. We approved it. It's good for the country. [Applause] My man.
And by the way, speaking of that, when I'm signing for the XL Pipeline and the Dakota, I said, by the way, who made the pipe? You don't want to know. [Audience chants USA] Donald Trump
Now, in all fairness to them, they bought a lot of their pipe already. So, it's a little hard to say throw that away, we're giving you, you know. But I put a little clause, handwritten. It said, anybody builds a pipeline in the United States will use American steel and fabricate in America. [Applause] No more taking it over on boats. [Applause] Very simple. [Applause]
We signed 39 pieces of legislation. That means going through Congress, folks. Because you know they tell you, these guys, the fake news. They tell you... [Booing] It's fake news, fake. [Booing] Not all of it. Some of it's good. And some of the people are great, actually. But some are real bad and they're really fake.
But if you listen to them, we didn't pass any -- we passed 39 -- I'm not talking about executive orders, which we've signed a lot. I mean, we have really signed a lot. And we've gotten rid of a lot of really bad pieces that were signed by President Obama, believe me. [Applause] But, if you listen to the fake news, they say like, he didn't pass any legislation. Everything's -- that's wrong. Thirty-nine pieces as of today, some of them very important.
Now, my biggest pieces are yet to come. Hopefully taxes. Hopefully health care. Hopefully infrastructure. And when they come, that won't be good enough either. See who it was. [Laughter] But we've also done a record number of resolutions to eliminate the job-killing regulations on our workers, our companies and our farmers. They're gone. They're gone. [Applause] We are ending the federal intrusion into your family farms and your ranches. [Applause]
And we're also working very, very hard to get rid of the death tax so that you can pass your farms onto your children and onto your grandchildren. [Applause] I don't know if we're going to pull that one off, but we're working very hard to do it. Right, Chris? [Applause] This way you can pass your motorcycle on, OK. Forget about the farm. That's not so bad either. I've seen what you -- what you ride. Not so bad.
But we're working on -- I don't know if that one's going to get pulled off, but it should because you should have a right. Why should you be double taxed? You should have a right to pass your farm onto your children and onto your grandchildren. You should have that right. [Applause] Without having them... [Applause]
Without having them going out and borrowing a fortune, not being able to make payments, losing it to the banks. It's not fair. So, we're working hard. Let's see if we pull it off. We're going to try very hard, I can tell you.
I don't know, but we're going to try. [Applause] No longer will the EPA be telling you how to run your business or do your job or live your life. Instead, it will focus on its true mission, clean air and clean, beautiful, crystal water. Nice, beautiful, clean water. That's what we want, right? Right? [Applause] We're also ending the last administration's federal land grab. We believe states, communities and private land owners know best how to manage their own resources. We've made a lot of progress in that, Ryan Zinke.
We want to see local control. That also means we're not going to let foreign bureaucrats plan our economy or tell Americans how to run their country. [Applause] You know what I mean. [Applause] When I campaigned for president, I promised to renegotiate or to leave any deal which fails to serve America's interests. And I'm not going to allow other countries to take advantage of the United States any longer.
And for that reason... [Applause] ... I totally cut off negotiations. I will not do our great, what is it? TPP? Yes? You guys weren't listening about it huh? [Laughter] But for that reason -- and that too.
As you know, I formally announced that the United States will withdraw from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord... [Applause] It's a disaster. It's a disaster. [Applause] And by the way, Trans-Pacific Partnership, we don't even talk about it anymore because that was done early. But Trans-Pacific Partnership, bye-bye. That was another NAFTA catastrophe that we're going to, by the way, renegotiate.
You know I announced I'm going to get rid of NAFTA. And I've always told you -- or either renegotiate or terminate NAFTA. So, I announced that essentially I was going to terminate. But I got a very, very nice call from Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada... [Booing] From the president... [Booing] ... a good guy, of Mexico asking me not to terminate it, could we negotiate? And I'm always willing to negotiate. [Applause]
I'm always willing. So, we'll see. [Applause] We'll see how it ends. [Applause] But it's been very unfair to the United States. All you have to do is look at all the empty buildings, all the empty plants and factories all over the country. NAFTA has been a disaster. So, we're going to either renegotiate it successfully, which would be my first choice. Or we're going to terminate it and that's going to be that. [Applause]
Now, the Paris Agreement, and it's amazing how the people of this country get it because the press covers it so unfairly. The Paris Agreement would've cost America millions of lost jobs and billions and billions of lost dollars, and put us at a permanent economic disadvantage. China doesn't kick in until 2030.
I could tell you stories. I could give you stats. I could go on all day. It's a catastrophe if we would've agreed. And they all say it's nonbinding. Like hell it's nonbinding. When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was nonbinding, then you can tell me it was nonbinding.
I was elected to serve the citizens of Iowa and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan... [Applause] ... and Wisconsin and Florida and all 50 states and all 320 million American citizens. [Applause, chating USA] By the way, this is a big place. This place.
And you know, I used to say during the campaign, I'm sure it hasn't changed. But we're not even campaigning and look at this crowd. So, you know it's easier during a campaign. The place is packed with thousands of people trying to get in. Look at the size of this place. They'll never show the crowd. [Booing] They'll never show the crowd. They'll never show the crowd.
That's the only good thing about the protesters, which we don't have very much of. I mean, this guy's blowing a whistle, you know. [Laughter] He's the Bernie Sanders guy. [Applause] But, but we don't have -- but when we do have one, the only good thing is the cameras have to go, and they have to go sometimes up into the little corners way up in that arena. Every seat is packed. Look at that. [Applause] Every seat. Every corner is packed of this big, big arena. So, it's an honor.
Wouldn't it be great if they showed -- you know, it's funny, I go home and my wife would say, Melania, who, by the way, has become very popular. [Applause] They're liking her. They're liking her. [Applause] But she'd say, I never saw the crowd, but it sounded like a lot of people. You know, you could tell. You can't imitate the sound of this many people. This is not like 500 people. This is big stuff. You can't imitate that. You know what they don't understand? They get these massive ratings. I hate to give it.
They probably charge a -- I know they charge a fortune. But all those television cameras, all those live ones. And I hate to do this, but they get even better ratings if they show that. And I try and convince them, but that they can't do. They just can't mentally handle that one, so it's whatever. [Applause] But it is, it's such a great crowd. So, to all of those people watching, it's an unbelievable place.
It is a big, beautiful arena and it is packed. [Applause] So, as you may know, there is another absolutely terrible deal from the previous administration. See how nice I am? I say the previous administration as opposed to the Obama administration. [Booing] That I have recently rescinded. Last week I announced that we are canceling the prior administration's completely one-sided deal with the Castro regime in Cuba. [Applause]
Isn't it amazing? Obama can deal with Cuba, kills thousands of people, people in prison, horrible to women, horrible to every -- can deal with Iran. You talk about bad? The gays, the women, the -- bad to everybody, kill, brutal. I deal with anybody, but Donald Trump is a terrible human being. It's unbelievable isn't it? Isn't it unbelievable? [Applause] It's unbelievable.
But America will stand strong against Communist oppression. We will make a much better deal. I mean, the fact is the deal with Cuba's a bad deal. We'll probably make a deal. Or maybe we won't. Maybe we won't. But you know what? If we make a deal, it's going to be a fair deal and a good deal for us. It's not going to be a one-sided giveaway. [Applause] We're also fighting every single day to achieve those fair trade deals for American factories, and your farmers and your ranches.
Heading up our effort to represent America's interest in China will be a man you know very well. I just left an event where I honored him, introduced him to a crowd of people that adore him. To discuss how to create -- I mean, he's been doing this for years in Iowa. He's the longest serving governor in American history. And now he carries the title of Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad. [Applause] He's a fantastic guy.
You know I told the story today. I said, I come here to make a speech. We have a big crowd in Iowa. And Terry would come and say -- at that time he didn't call me Mr. President. He called me Donald. I said, that's OK. I didn't think about. Now if he called me Donald I'd be very angry with him, right? [Laughter] But he said, Donald, could you do me a favor?
Don't say anything bad about China. We do a lot of business with China. I like China a lot. I've known President Xi for a long time. I really like him. And he also, by the way, likes Terry a lot. And just please don't say anything bad about China. Which is hard for me to do. [Laughter] And I wouldn't.
But then when I won and were looking for somebody to represent us with China, which is a very, very powerful country, and we've had a very good relationship with China, in all fairness, and I do like President Xi. I wish we would have a little more help with respect to North Korea from China, but that doesn't seem to be working out. [Applause] But I do like the president a lot.
So, when I was thinking of who am I going to make the ambassador to China, after you know, having a good, retentive mind. I said you know I remember about a year ago when Terry Branstad was saying all of these great things, your governor.
So, I called him up and I said listen, you've been doing this for 24 years. You want to do something else? Like how would you like to be ambassador to China? And I didn't think he'd really do it. [Laughter] It's a long trip. Twenty-one hours? That's a lot of plane time.
But he wants to do what's right for the country. And I said to him tonight, I said, I wasn't sure you were going to do it. He said, when my president calls me to help him with our great country, I do it. That's what he said to me. I thought it was nice. [Applause] Thought it was nice. Right? [Applause]
So, central to that economic agenda is a plan to restore America's crumbling infrastructure. We will rebuild not only America, but we will rebuild rural America. [Applause] In this great national rebuilding, we will follow two simple rules.
We will buy American and we will hire American. [Applause] We want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. [Applause] We also want to preserve our safety net for struggling Americans who truly need help. We want to help them, people who truly need help, right, Chris? We want to help those people. [Applause] But others don't treat us fairly.
That's why I believe the time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years. [Applause] And we'll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.
Another core principle is that those coming to our country must embrace our values and love our people. [Applause] And yes, we will build the wall. We've already started planning. It will be built. [Applause, chating Build the Wall] We will build the wall. We need it. We need it. We have to stop the drugs from flowing in.
You know, people don't realize, we're already spending a lot of money on design. But I'll give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet. And I'm not sure, but I'm a builder. That's what I love to do. That's probably what I do best. I'm a builder.
And we're thinking of something that's unique. We're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. [Applause] And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money. And that's good, right? Is that good. [Applause] You're the first group I've told that to, a solar wall. Makes sense. Let's see. We're working it out. We'll see. Solar wall, panels, beautiful.
I mean actually think of it. The higher it goes, the more valuable it is. It's like... [Laughter] Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea. So, we have a good shot.
That's one of the places that solar really does work, the tremendous sun and heat. It really does work there. So, we'll see what happens with that. That would be great. And I think we could make it look beautiful too. It would really look beautiful. So, that would be nice.
We're also working night and day to restore law and order to our country, law and order. [Applause] You know that. [Applause] We're reversing the last administration's soft on crime policies that helped enable a tragic rise in violent crime. You see what's happening. Look at Chicago. What the hell is going on in Chicago? What's that all about?
We have also issued new directives to protect our police officers and our sheriffs. [Applause] And we'll always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] All American children, no matter where they live, have the right to grow up in a safe community. No issue is more central to public safety than the issue of immigration and border security.
After years of lawlessness, the United States is now enforcing our laws, first time in a long time. And protecting our workers, our schools and our families. Since I was elected, illegal border crossings, and this is without the wall.
Before the wall, have decreased by more than 75 percent, a historic and unprecedented achievement. [Applause] So, we're building the wall on the southern border. We've got the greatest security people in the world. I'll tell you, ICE and the Border Patrol folks, these are incredible people.
You know they endorsed me when I ran for president, knowing that if I win they're going to have to work much, much harder. But they love this country, and they want the job done, and they want the job done right. They have to work harder and it's much more dangerous.
The other thing that I have to tell you. You have a gang called MS-13. [Booing] A friend of mine who's a very, very high-level police officer said to me in describing them, they are the equivalent or worse than al-Qaeda. I would say that's a bad statement.
They don't like to shoot people. They like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe. These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the thousands. [Applause] And the people moving them out are guess what, a hell of a lot tougher and meaner than they are. But they're on our side. [Applause] We're getting them out, MS-13.
During my campaign for president, I met with the families of Americans killed by illegal immigrants, many, many families. Including the parents of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowa girl who was killed the day after she graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA.
Do you know what that is? To those of you who don't know, that means solid A's straight across, number one student. Thousands of beautiful American lives like Sarah's have been stolen for the simple reason that our government has refused to enforce already existing laws. The media, these people, like to talk about... [Booing] ... separating families.
But the families they never talk about are the American families separated forever from the ones they love because we don't protect our borders and uphold the immigration laws of the United States. [Applause] These families and the victims have been ignored totally by the media. They were ignored by the consultants. They've been ignored by Washington.
But these Americans were not ignored by me or by you, and we know who they are. [Applause] And they rise now to the highest level. They rise to the highest level. I promise those families the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain, and that we will take strong and forceful action to fulfill our sacred duty to save and protect American lives. [Applause] Every single day we are finding these gang members, these drug dealers, thieves, robbers, predators, criminals, killers, horrible killers, and we are throwing them the hell out of our country. [Applause]
And when they're gone, our now very strong borders, especially with the wall, will never allow them back in. [Applause] So, we're doing a lot of things. We're very proud of what we've done. Just as Gorsuch was a big, big deal. Big deal. [Applause] Somebody explained it to be beautifully. They said, when you pick a Supreme Court judge, you want great intellect, you want all of the things. But you also want youth because they'll be there for 40 years.
So, if Judge Gorsuch, who I've gotten to know, who I think is a fantastic human being, aside from being a brilliant, brilliant student and person, and one of the great legal writers that exists in our country, probably in the world, today.
Every time you see a decision written over the next 30 or 40 years, and especially if it's a 5 to 4 decision, like perhaps on Second Amendment or so many other things, you have done something that you can't value. It's so important.
Think of it. For a 30- to 40-year period, potentially, you've influenced this country. And I've always heard long that just about the most important thing you can do. I always say defense. But perhaps outside, because we are going to have a strong military and strong defense and we need it now. [Applause] But I've always heard that the most important thing a president can do is pick a great Supreme Court justice.
So, I've got one. Probably have some more. But it is really important. And think of that. Over years and years those decisions that are so important, values, great values.
So, I'm very, very proud of that pick. He's already been there now for almost two months. And people are saying wow, that is a tremendous person and a tremendous intellect. So, we're all very proud of that pick. And you made it possible. [Applause] So, I began this campaign on June 16th, a couple of days ago two years. It's my birthday on June 14th, Flag Day of all things.
And we came down the escalator, that famous escalator ride. Melania, myself. And the place went nuts. And hopefully because they like me, but I think also they like the policies. I said the truth.
I talked about immigration. I talked about what was happening on the borders. I talked about our military. I talked about the drug problems which are tremendous. Even in Iowa, tremendous problems beyond anything we've ever seen before. I talked about all of it.
And you know what? We were never off center stage in the debates. We stayed -- you know what that means. We were number one all the way through, all the way through. We were number one all the way through because of people like you. Never off center. [Applause] Seventeen people running. I kept looking up and down. I said, boy that's a lot of people.
Some of them very talented. But 17 people running. We were never off center stage in those debates. And that's because of people like yourselves because you agree with me. And we are making such incredible progress. We are making progress like nobody can believe. These people are being driven crazy, crazy. [Applause] I mean, they have phony witch hunts going against me. They have everything going. And you know what? All we do is win, win, win. We won last night. They can't believe it. They're saying what is going on? What is going on? [Applause]
We won last night. And even the worst of them said, that was a big win for Trump. I couldn't believe it actually. Thank you very much, folks. I appreciate it. But we have made a journey together like no other ever in the history of this country. And maybe beyond that. But you look in the history of this country, there's never been anything like this that's happened. We're straightening out through common sense and through a good heart, we're straightening out our country. We're straightening out our country. [Applause]
No matter our beliefs, no matter our party, it's time for us to remember that we are all Americans and that we are in this together. And it would be great if the Republicans and the Democrats could come together and get really, really great legislation passed. [Applause] Some of the geniuses were saying this morning, you know, from the time he announced on June 16th two years ago, they've been hitting the hell out of him.
Hillary took almost all negative ads. The problem was, when people went to vote, they didn't know what she stood for other than she was saying bad things about me. And I almost became like... [Applause] So, from the time I announced, I've been hit, hit, hit. Then from the time I got in, I said oh, this is going to be great. Finally, we can all come together.
They hit me harder, harder, harder. They've now learned, I think, that that doesn't work. [Applause] Five and 0. Five and 0. It doesn't work. [Applause] They need to be positive. They can't continue to be obstructionists. That's all they have going.
So, they should come together. I don't think they will. But I will tell you, it will be a beautiful, beautiful thing if we could get together as two parties that love our country and come up with that great health care, and come up with that great tax deal for our people and tax reform. And infrastructure and so many other great things. [Applause]
Just think about what a unified American nation could achieve. Nobody could even come close to us. And by the way, even if we're not totally unified, nobody's coming close to us here. Don't worry about it. Gleaming new roads and bridges that would inspire awe and wonder all over the world. You know, we used to be the leader in airports. We had the most beautiful airports.
Now we're more like a third world country. LaGuardia, Newark, LAX, Kennedy. They're like third-world airports. Take a look. Take a look. We used to be the leader. Now you go to Saudi Arabia, where I just came back. A monumental, epic trip because I said you cannot continue to fund terrorism. You cannot continue to fund terrorism. [Applause] And the king of Saudi Arabia, who is really become just he's a very special man.
I mean that. He has taken it to heart. And now they're fighting with other countries that have been funding terrorism. And I think we had a huge impact. We will see. But I think we had a tremendous impact.
We cannot let these incredibly rich nations fund radical Islamic terror or terrorism of any kind. We cannot let it happen. Cannot let it happen. [Applause] It was one of the great two days of my life. And I'm sure a lot of you watched it on television. Fifty-four Muslim nations coming together, some immensely powerful, wealthy nations, and every [Inaudible] was unified and [Inaudible] weren't they're trying to get them to be unified and to do the right thing. I think it could have a tremendous impact.
But not only that, I said for me to go I'm only going, we had to negotiate, if you spend billions of dollars, billions, on having things manufactured in our country with our jobs and our workers for your country. And hundreds of billions of dollars was spent and given to American companies who are going to make American products and send those products over to the wealthy countries of the Middle East.
I mean hundreds of billions of dollars. [Applause] And people haven't talked about that. But to me that was very important because we want those jobs. We want those jobs. So, they're making [Inaudible] sorts of things. Hundreds of billions of dollars. And it's going back. And I'm very proud of that. That's something people don't talk about because the real purpose of my being there was to make sure these countries do not fund terror any longer. [Applause] So, I just want to leave Iowa. I said that I'd come back. Oh, I love that you're not -- look. Look at that.
You know I'm going to leave. I don't want to leave either. I don't want to leave either. I don't want to leave either. But I said I would come back. And I made lots of statements to your governor and to your current governor. Kim is going to be a fantastic governor. She's here. [Applause] She's going to be a fantastic governor.
But I said that I was going to come back. I said that I was going to protect your ethanol, for good reason. Only for good reason. And it was a very important to me. I said that I was going to do things for the people of Iowa. And I want to let you know, I've done it for the people of Iowa, but I've really done it for the people of our country.
Our country is getting stronger, it's getting better. We're going to be setting records in so many different ways. We're going to straighten out all of the mess that's happened over the last long period of time where we went into other nations to tell them how to run their country, and we had no idea.
But I just want to thank all of the people that are here tonight. I want to thank the people of Iowa. You are incredible people. I want to thank you for your incredible support. [Applause] And I just want to let you know that God blesses you. And I want to just say you are special in every way. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause]"
2017-06-16,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-june-16-2017,"My fellow Americans. This week, our nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a member of Congress. Five people were wounded in the assault, including a member of House leadership, my good friend, Steve Scalise. Steve is beloved across Washington. He embodies everything public service is about. He's dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values, and deeply committed to his country.
I visited Steve, his wife and his family in the hospital, as he continues to fight for his recovery. 435 members of Congress and 300 million Americans are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support. We continue to hold all of those wounded in fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded. In that terrible crime we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police.
Special agent Crystal Greiner, who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the hospital, raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey. They saved the lives of our members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination.
They, like so many other courageous police officers, represent the very best of us. We salute them, and we also salute members of the Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue. Though we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of our country, our devotion to its people. Now more than ever, these values must guide us, andnd bring us closer together. Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American people, and that we are all children of the same God.
This week, my administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all. On Thursday I signed an executive order to launch a groundbreaking new apprenticeship initiative that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families. We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American worker.
American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be. No matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous. They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers. They create works of art from burning fire and molten steel. They mime the Earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns. They care for the sick, the elderly and the wounded, and they lay the bricks, mortar, rebar and concrete that give us places to live, to work and to thrive.
Today, this is the message I want every young American to hear. There is dignity in every honest job. And there is nobility in every honest worker. Our apprenticeship initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups and unions, to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high paying careers. Instead of being racked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn. Think of that. Earn while they learn.
Under our plan, young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers. They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing. They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art. And they will become entrepreneurs, who revolutionized entire industries. And the striving American citizens, including millions of talented young American women, with tremendous potential, will become the programmers to change the world with the next great technological advance.
Every American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love. That begins with the right education, one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success. Every day as your president I will be committed to this goal. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-06-09,Remarks: Donald Trump Speaks at the Department of Transportation,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-transportation-regulation-june-9-2017,"Thank you, Secretary Chao. Thank you, everybody. This is very nice, by the way. Beautiful. I want to really thank you. You have been so amazing as the leader of this department, and the progress is being made so quickly. Leaders and officials gathered here from across the country have all praised the work that the Secretary is doing to create a safe, modern and reliable transportation system for the United States and for its great, great, great people.
I also want to thank Secretary Zinke for the fantastic job he's doing at the Department of the Interior to clear the way for new infrastructure and economic development. Both Secretary Chao and Zinke joined us at the White House yesterday for a meeting with state and local leaders to develop plans to replace America's decaying infrastructure and construct new roads, rails, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges all across our nation.
We are here today to focus on solving one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately needed infrastructure, and that is the painfully slow, costly, and time-consuming process of getting permits and approvals to build. And I also knew that from the private sector. It is a long, slow, unnecessarily burdensome process.
My administration is committed to ending these terrible delays once and for all. The excruciating wait time for permitting has inflicted enormous financial pain to cities and states all throughout our nation and has blocked many important projects from ever getting off the ground. Many, many projects are long gone because they couldn't get permits and there was no reason for it.
We've already taken historic steps to speed up the approvals, including the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline -- which was very quickly approved. They were sitting there for a long time saying, well, that project is dead. Then I came into office and, all of the sudden, a miracle. And I guarantee you, the consultants went over to the heads of the company and told them what a great job they did. They asked for a lot of money, most likely. But we got it approved. And we got it approved fast.
I'm also very proud to say that the Dakota Access Pipeline is now officially open for business. It was dead 120 days ago, and now it officially just opened for business. Very proud of that. Hi, Bill.
We're also excited to be joined by representatives from our labor unions, including the North America Building Trades Union, which I know well, and the Laborers International Union of North America. You will play a -- go ahead, fellas, take a little credit. Come on, fellas. You will play a central role in rebuilding America. Very important.
We're also joined, as well, by many distinguished members of Congress who share our total passion and desire to repair and restore America's highways, railways, and waterways. In the audience is Chairman Bill Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Stand up, Bill. Thank you, Bill, great job -- who is working very closely with us, including on our proposal to dramatically reduce airport delays by reforming air traffic control.
We have an obsolete system. And I have to say, before Elaine got here, they had spent close to $7 billion on the system. Boom -- a waste. All wasted. But we're going to have a great system -- great new system. A top of the line -- it will be the best in the world. Right now, we're at the lowest part of the pack. It will be the best in the world, for a lot less money than they've been wasting for years.
For too long, America has poured trillions and trillions of dollars into rebuilding foreign countries while allowing our own country -- the country that we love -- and its infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. We have structurally deficient bridges, clogged roads, crumbling dams and locks. Our rivers are in trouble. Our railways are aging. And chronic traffic that slows commerce and diminishes our citizens' quality of life. Other than that, we're doing very well.
Instead of rebuilding our country, Washington has spent decades building a dense thicket of rules, regulations and red tape. It took only four years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State Building. People don't believe that. It took less than one year. But today, it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project.
These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process. It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes.
As one example -- and this happened just 30 minutes ago -- I was sitting with a great group of people responsible for their state's economic development and roadways. All of you are in the room now. And one gentleman from Maryland was talking about an 18-mile road. And he brought with him some of the approvals that they've gotten and paid for. They spent $29 million for an environmental report, weighing 70 pounds and costing $24,000 per page.
And I said, do me a favor. I'm going to make a speech in a little while. Do you mind if I take that and show it? So I'm going to show it. So they spent millions and millions of dollars. When I said, how long has this short roadway been talked about, the gentleman said, well, if you say 20 years, you're safe. I said, yeah, don't say anymore because I have to be -- you know, I have to be exactly accurate with these people. I was off by like two months -- it's a major front-page story.
But these binders on the stage could be replaced by just a few simple pages, and it would be just as good. It was actually be much better. Because these binders also make you do unnecessary things that cost billions and billions of dollars and they actually make it worse.
As another example, the 23 -- if you look at it, in Ohio, the Ohio River Bridge -- $2.3 billion. The project amassed a 150,000-page administrative record -- 150,000 pages is a five-story-tall building. Think of it. If you put the paper together, it's a five-story building.
How can a country prosper under this kind of nonsense? And I know it. I know it so well, being in the private sector. But you know, in the private sector you move, and you wheel, and you deal, and you hope, and you pray. And maybe it goes a little faster, but it's a horrible thing in the private sector also. And we're talking about reducing that for the private sector likewise.
Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? Oftentimes, the consultants -- that are making a fortune because you can't doing anything without hiring them, paying them a tremendous amount of money, having them write up this nonsense -- you can't get approvals. And they're in, in the case of New York, Albany -- they go to Albany, the state capital or, here, they go to Washington for federal. And they want to make it really tough because that way, you have to hire them. It's a terrible thing.
It's a group of people -- probably nobody has ever heard anybody talk about it because -- I know it because I'm a business guy, I understand that. They work really hard to make it difficult. And some are believers, but most aren't. Most want to make a lot of money. So they make a very, very simple roadway or whatever you want to be building a very complicated subject, and they make it very much more expensive and they make it worse. It's not as good as it would have been.
I was not elected to continue a failed system. I was elected to change it. All of us in government service were elected to solve the problems that have plagued our nation. We are here to think big, to act boldly, and to rise above the petty partisan squabbling of Washington D.C. We are here to take action. It's time to start building in our country, with American workers and with American iron, and aluminum and steel. It's time to put up soaring new infrastructure that inspires pride in our people and our towns.
When I approved the Keystone Pipeline I said, where was the pipe made? Unfortunately, they had purchased a lot of it, but I put a little clause at the bottom -- you want to build a pipeline in this country, buy American steel and let it be fabricated here. Very simple little clause written in hand, but it does the trick.
It is time, at last, to put America First. Americans deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world. They deserve roads and bridges that are safe to travel, and pipes that deliver clean water into their homes. Not like what happened in Flint, Michigan. They deserve lanes of commerce that get people and products where they need to go on time. Most of all, Americans deserve a system of infrastructure that is looked upon not with pity -- the world, in many cases, is so far advanced that they look at our infrastructure as being sad. We want them to look at us with envy -- a system worthy of our magnificent country.
No longer can we allow these rules and regulations to tie down our economy, chain up our prosperity, and sap our great American spirit. That is why we will lift these restrictions and unleash the full potential of the United States of America.
To all our state and local leaders, I appreciate you being here today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. I want you to know that help is finally -- after many, many decades -- on its way. We are giving control back to the cities and the states. You know best how to plan your communities, analyze your projects, and protect your local environment.
We will get rid of the redundancy and duplication that wastes your time and your money. Our goal is to give you one point of contact to deliver one decision -- yes or no -- for the entire federal government, and to deliver that decision quickly, whether it's a road, whether it's a highway, a bridge, a dam.
To do this, we are setting up a new council to help project managers navigate the bureaucratic maze. This council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process. This council will make sure that every federal agency that is consistently delaying projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties. I know it won't happen with these two. We don't have to worry about them. We will hold the bureaucracy accountable.
We are also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal and state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in their way.
This massive permit reform -- and that's what it is; it's a permit reform -- doesn't sound glamorous. They won't write stories about it. They won't even talk about it. But it's so important. But it's only the first step in renewing America's roads, rails, runways and rivers.
As I discussed in Ohio recently, my new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment -- which we desperately need. We've spent, as of a few months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East. Think of it -- $6 trillion in the Middle East. And it's worse than it was 15 years ago by a factor of 10. And yet, if you want to build a little road in one of your communities in Pennsylvania or Ohio, or in Iowa, or in North Carolina, or in Florida, you can't get the money.
State and local leaders will have more power to decide which projects get built, when they start and how they are funded. And investors will have a much more predictable environment that encourages them to invest billions of dollars in capital that is currently stuck on the sidelines.
Together, we will build projects to inspire our youth, employ our workers, and create true prosperity for our people. We will pour new concrete, lay new brick, and watch new sparks light our factories as we forge metal from the furnaces of our Rust Belt and our beloved heartland -- which has been forgotten. It's not forgotten anymore.
We will put new American steel into the spine of our country. American workers will construct gleaming new lanes of commerce across our landscape. They will build these monuments from coast to coast, and from city to city. And with these new roads, bridges, airports and seaports, we will embark on a wonderful new journey into a bright and glorious future.
We will build again. We will grow again. We will thrive again. And we will Make America Great Again. Thank you. God bless you. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you."
2017-06-09,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-june-9-2017,"My fellow Americans. We are the nation that built the Golden Gate Bridge in four years, and the Hoover Dam in five. Now, it takes as much as a decade just a plan a major permit, for a major infrastructure, or anything even remotely major in our country, and that's ridiculous. And it's going to change.
This week, I laid out a bold and exciting new vision for the infrastructure in America that will make our country faster, safer and wealthier. Frankly, it will make our country greater. For too long, America has spent trillions and trillions of dollars building up other countries while our own country decayed, and our own people suffered. Our highways and railways and airports and seaports have all been neglected, and it's holding our economy back. But now, our economy is starting to roar, and it's time to rebuild our great nation, and we have to think big and think big again.
My new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. We're going to give states and localities more power to decide what projects get built and how they're funded, and we're going to get government out of the way by massively cutting the federal approval time for infrastructure projects of a major nature, so that America can build again.
We will also revolutionize air travel in America. At a time when every passenger has GPS technology in their pockets, our air traffic controllers rely on technology so outdated it's no longer manufactured. Our controllers do a great job with the technology they have, but all the flight delays and inefficiency still cost our economy $25 billion every single year.
We're proposing to move our air traffic control system to a new, self-financing nonprofit organization. It won't need any taxpayer money, and the FAA will still be in charge of safety. Many other countries have done this, and the results have been absolutely incredible.
Next, we're going to revitalize the 12,000 miles of inland waterways, the lifeblood of the American heartland. Our agriculture, steel and energy producers all depend on these critical corridors, and a single tow boat can haul the same load as 1,000 18-wheelers. We're going to fix our 50-year old system of locks and dams so American producers can get their products to market quickly, reliably and efficiently.
In the coming weeks and months, I will outline additional projects to rebuild American infrastructure, all of which can be achieved through my vision for a new partnership between Washington, states and the private sector.
With the talent, skill, and drive of the American people, there is no doubt to the beautiful future we can create together. All it takes is a bold and daring vision, and the will to make it real. America is going to build again, under budget and ahead of schedule. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."

Thank you, Ralph, for that really kind introduction, and for your great leadership. It's wonderful to be back here with all of my friends at this time. Who would have known this was going to happen? We had a feeling, didn't we?
And, Ralph, I want to congratulate you and your wife, Joanne, and each and every person in the audience today. In just a few years you've helped turn a small organization into a really nationwide, beautiful movement. [Applause] So true. And what you have achieved is extraordinary. I have spoken to this group so much, so often. I'll be back.
Most recently, one year ago this week when I came here to ask for your support your help and your prayers. And, wow, did you deliver. You really did. Last year you knocked on more than 1.2 million doors in the key battleground states, where, as you'll remember, we focused, supposed to be focusing on those states.
You sent 22 million pieces of mail, shared 16 million videos, and made 10 million phone calls. That's something. [Applause] And I'm honored by your incredible support and grateful for your commitment to our shared cause. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you very much. [Applause]
You didn't let me down, and I will never, ever let you down. You know that. [Applause] We will always support our evangelical community and defend your right and the right of all Americans to follow and to live by the teachings of their faith. And as you know, we're under siege, you understand that, but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. You watch. [Applause]
You fought hard for me and now I'm fighting hard for all of you. I have one goal as president, to fight for the American people and to fight for America and America first. [Applause]
We are going to battle for every American who has lost a job, for every family was lost a loved one, for every American of faith has lost their rights and lost their freedom. The forgotten men and women will never ever be forgotten again. You know about that. [Applause]
Remember they said, where did all these people come from? And you know what, they're still trying to figure it out. They don't get it. They don't get it.
Your voices will resound across the halls of our capital, and across the world. We recite today the words of Isaiah chapter 1, verse 17, ""Learn to do right, seek justice, defend the oppressed, take up the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.""
The entrenched interests and failed bitter voices in Washington will do everything in their power to try and stop us from this righteous cause, to try to stop all of you. They will lie, they will obstruct, they will spread their hatred and their prejudice, but we will not back down from doing what is right, because as the Bible tells us... [Applause] ... we know that the truth will prevail, that God's glorious wisdom will shine through, and that the good and decent people of this country will get the change they voted for and that they so richly deserve. [Applause]
Nothing worth doing ever came easy, but we know how to fight better than anybody, and we never ever would give up, and we do not give up. We are winners, and we are going to fight and win, and have an unbelievable future, unbelievable future, and it's going to be together. [Applause]
We are keeping the solemn promises that we made to the great citizens of our country. We are eliminating job-killing regulations, reversing government overreach, and returning power back to everyday Americans, where the country started. [Applause]
In just a short period of time, we've already added nearly 1 million new jobs and approved historic increases in military spending. We have achieved a record reduction in illegal immigration. Did you see at the southern border -- 75 percent, 75 percent. [Applause]
If they'd do 1 percent in the past, it used to be, aw, we're doing so well -- 75 percent. General Kelly is doing a great job. And we are protecting our families, schools and cities by removing the gang members... [Applause] -- MS-13, MS-13, we're spreading them out -- the drug dealers and criminals from our country and cracking down on the sanctuary cities that protect them. [Applause]
And we believe that people who come to our country should love our citizens, and embrace our values -- our values, folks. In my first 100 days -- and I don't think anybody has ever done more, or certainly not much more -- I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late, great Antonin Scalia. [Applause] And now Justice Gorsuch has a seat on the United States Supreme Court. [Applause] Made a promise.
We have also proposed a historic tax cut, biggest in the history of our country, by the way, and we are fighting for fair trade that creates a level playing field for all of our American companies and our American workers. We are not only fair playing field, but it's getting fairer by the day. We are bringing back our jobs. [Applause]
To protect those jobs and the sovereignty and freedom of the United States, I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. [Applause] Thank you. You understand it. You understand how bad it was for our country. It was going to strip us of our jobs, our wealth, our companies, and they keep saying, oh, it's nonbinding, so innocent. I figure between that deal, the Iran deal, NAFTA -- we've got some beauties, don't we? [Laughter]
Don't worry, you're going to see some real good ones coming about very soon. You're going to see some great ones coming about very soon. America will continue to lead the world on environmental protection. We're going to have clean water, crystal clean. We're going to have clean air. [Applause]
But what we won't do is let other countries take advantage of the United States anymore, and dictate what we are doing and dictate our future. [Applause] From now on, we will follow a very simple rule: Every day I am president, we are going to make America first, not somebody else, not some other country. We are going to make America first. [Applause]
Thank you. As I am sure you know, I have also reinstated the Mexico City policy first put into place by Ronald Reagan to protect the unborn. [Applause] Thank you.
And in a really beautiful ceremony at the White House on the National Day of Prayer I signed, as I promised I would, a new executive action to protect religious liberty in America, including protecting the rights of group like yours, the Little Sisters of the Poor. [Applause]
Thank you. Stand up -- the Little Sisters of... [Applause] They fought so hard for so many years. All of a sudden they heard, we won, right? [Laughter] They were tough. Don't want to mess with the Little Sisters, right? [Laughter] They hung in. They had a lot of losses. They sustained a lot of losses, but all of a sudden, one day, a few weeks ago, it was over; they won. So congratulations. Great toughness, great. Great people. [Applause]
That executive order also followed on one of my campaign promises to so many of you, to stop the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment Rights. [Applause]
That was my promise. This executive order directs the IRS not to unfairly target churches and religious organizations for political speech. So the people that you most respect can now feel free to speak to you, like my friends sitting right over here. I can now hear them, and they're unimpeded.
So I just want to congratulate everybody in this room, because that was a big deal and it was a very important thing for me to do for you. And we're not finished yet, believe me. We're not finished yet. So thank you very much. [Applause]
No federal worker should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors. These are the people we want to hear from. How about the people we do hear from every night on television. You want to hear from them? I don't think so. Now, now. We want to hear from the people that we want to hear from.
As long as I'm president, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart, and from preaching -- and really this is so important, from the bottom of my heart, from preaching from the people that you most want to hear and that you so respect, so we have taken a very, very strong position, and you picked a winner. [Applause]
So we want our pastors thinking out. We want their voices in our public discourse, and we want our children to know the blessings of God. [Applause] School should not be a place that drive out faith and religion. [Applause] But that should welcome faith and religion with wide, open, beautiful arms. [Applause]
Faith inspires us to be better, to be stronger, to be more caring and giving, and more determined to act in selfless and courageous defense of what is good and what is right. It is time to put a stop to the attacks on religion. [Applause] Thank you.
We will end the discrimination against people of faith. Our government will once again celebrate and protect religious freedom. [Applause] Restoring freedom and opportunity also means repealing and replacing the disaster known as... [Audience yells ""Obamacare""] TRUMP: That was easy. [Laughter] Do you see how it's failing?
Okay, so I have been saying all hundred and 116 percent for so long. That was Arizona. That was -- so yesterday I have a new number -- 204 percent in Alaska increase. It is a catastrophe. Obamacare, as one of the big insurance companies had said, is in a spiral; it's in a death spiral. It is dead, dead. Some of the states are losing their insurance companies. Yesterday Ohio lost one of the big ones. And Ohio's got problems now. They've all got problems. Kentucky, Tennessee, everyplace I go.
But we're dealing with obstructionists. The Democrats or obstructionist. You know what, it would be great to get along with them, but it seems to be impossible. They are obstructionists, and they have a healthcare plan that's a disaster, called Obamacare. Again, the insurance companies are fleeing. The premiums are through the roof. The deductibles -- I mean, unless you die a long, horrible slow death, those deductibles are so high. Sadly, folks, you'll never get the use of it.
It is a disaster what's going on with Obamacare. Nobody wants to talk about it. But you take a look at the premiums, how high. You take a look at those deductibles, you have nothing, and then of course the mandate. Let's pay to get out of it, okay. We're only one -- we pay to get out of not paying. That's how bad it is.
So Obamacare is dead, and don't let them pin it on the Republicans, by the way. We've only been here for a short period of time. Okay, but a good bill passed on the House. Something I hope great is going to come out through Mitch McConnell of the Senate, and we're working very hard. I can tell you, we're really working hard. And if we had the best plan, in the history of the world, we wouldn't get one Democrat vote, just remember that.
If we had a plan that gave you the greatest healthcare ever in history, you wouldn't get one Democrat vote, because they're obstructionists. They're bad right now for the country. They've gone so far left that I don't know if they can ever come back. Now as a, believe it or not, politician -- I'd never would call myself a politician, but I guess that's what I am. I became president,. I guess I'm a politician. [Laughter]
Selfishly, I've loved where they've gone, because I think they've taken the wrong path. But they have gone so far left trying to appease a certain group, that I think they've made a horrible mistake. But what they have done is they've tried to obstruct, and that's why when it comes to the elections in '18, we have to get more because we only have, we're only up by two in the Senate, and a pretty small number in the House. And we have to build those numbers up because we're just not going to get votes.
Now maybe times will change and that could happen at some point. I remember when Republicans and Democrats would fight like hell, then they'd go out have lunch together, have dinner together, go back, fight like hell and get a lot of things done. Now the lunches and dinners don't take place. The level of hatred is beyond anything that I've ever seen.
So they're obstructionists, but we're going to get healthcare done. We're going to get the tax cares done -- the tax cuts. We have the biggest tax cut and great tax reform. We're going to get it done, but sadly we're going to have to do it as Republicans, because we won't get any Democrat votes, and that's a very, very sad, sad thing.
I filled my administration and cabinet with people who shared our priorities, and I want to deliver for the American people. And even that, as you know, it's so hard to process because of the obstruction. It's so hard. You know, they say resist, but they really should say obstruct. But it's so hard, because you put -- when you hear that we have vacancies, it's true, but take a look at what's going on. Getting the simplest appointment is a big deal that takes forever.
Our wonderful Vice President Mike Pence will be here later this week. What a great guy he is. [Applause]Great guy. When Dr. James Dobson -- [Applause] Stand up, James. Stand up, James. Good. [Applause] Great man. Great guy. [Applause] Thank you, James.
Receives a Lifetime Achievement award. But today I also want to congratulate Dr. Dobson and his wife, Shirley, who was with me at the beginning of the campaign, right at the beginning of the campaign. And I called back, but she was substituting for James, because he was so busy preaching. And I said, you know what, James, she may be better than you are. She was good. She was good. [Laughter]
We had a good time. Right? And I'll tell you right, the audience, they loved her. So, in advance of that recognition, James, and for everything they've both done, to keep the focus on the family I just want to congratulate you. It's just so amazing. Thank you. [Applause] Great, great people. [Applause] Great people, thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thanks, Shirley. Thanks, James.
Family is the foundation of American life, and we are proud to stand together with all of you to promote and protect family values. We're here today to celebrate two values that have always been linked together, and where Ralph, frankly, has done such a great job in linking them, faith and freedom. They're linked together because liberty comes from our creator. Our rights are given to us by a divine authority, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away. [Applause]
That is why my administration is taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the people where it belongs, said right from the beginning. [Applause] For too long, politicians have tried to centralize authority among the hands of a small few in our nation's capitol. People are getting very rich. Bureaucrats think they can run over your lives, overrule your values and tell you how to live.
But we know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community. [Applause] We know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise children and create a thriving society. [Applause] And above all else, we know this: In America we don't worship government. We worship God. [Applause] All right. We worship God. [Applause] Thank you.
Our religious liberty is enshrined in the very First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. The American founders invoked our creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Don't worry, we're not going to let them change it. [Applause]
You see what goes on nowadays, right? Benjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer. Inscribed on our currency are the words, ""In God We Trust,"" and we proudly proclaim that we are one nation, under God, every time we say the Pledge of Allegiance. You just heard a brave 6-year-old patriot named Christian Jacobs beautifully recite that Pledge of Allegiance.
I first met Christian last week after the Memorial Day Ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, where we honor and remember the American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. Christian was in perfect Marine dress blues, as a tribute to his dad, his beautiful dad. And he walked right up to me in a big crowd of people, and without hesitation, he asked if I would like to come see where his daddy is resting.
Next, he led me over to where Marine Sergeant Christopher Jacobs lies among his brothers and sisters in arms, in section 60, and showed me pictures of his fallen father, who is so great and so important to him.
Not only does young Christian carry those photos, but he carries his father's love in his heart and his courage in his beautiful, beaming young face.
With his mom Britney by his side -- terrific mother. I said, ""is your mother good or is she great?"" He said, ""She's great."" I said, ""You'd better say that."" [Laughter] He looked me square in the eyes and gave me a firm handshake. That 6-year-old stood strong, and tall and proud, in front of the commander-in-chief, just as I am sure his dad would have wanted him to be. He's extraordinary.
Christian's father... [Applause] Christian's father gave his life to defend our freedoms and our flag. Christian, your father was an American hero, and we are so proud of what you are doing every day to carry on his legacy. And, Christian, we hope to prove worthy of the sacrifices your family has made. And believe me, we're going to work very hard to live up to your standard.
Christian, stand up. [Applause] Come on Christian. [Applause] Thanks, Christian. Good job. Good job. Special guy. Every day, our brave men and women in uniform are risking their lives to keep this country safe from murderous Groups like ISIS, Al Qaeda, so many more. We must confront this evil that plagues humanity, and eradicate it from our planet. [Applause]
The vicious slaughters in Manchester and the streets of London underscore the depths of depravity that we face. But these atrocities only harden our resolve. We're getting better and better and tougher and tougher and smarter and smarter, Christian.
We cannot allow radical Islamic terrorism to spread in our country, or allow extremists to find sanctuary on her shores. [Applause] We will protect our country. We will protect our families, and our ways of life will always be protected. We will crush this enemy that is waging war on all of civilization.
Last month I traveled to Saudi Arabia to speak to the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab countries, and to rally them in the common fight against terrorism, which is a menace to people of all religions. There can be no coexistence with this violence.
I told these leaders that they must drive out this enemy from the face of the earth. Every child of God, no matter where they live, what language they speak or what book they live by, deserves to be able to grow up in harmony, dignity and peace. In that summit, the likes of which there has never been any summit like it -- you've seen it, you watched it -- We reached historic agreements to fight not only terrorism but the wicked ideology that really drives it.
I mean, it's just driving it. And to starve this enemy of the funds -- the billions and billions and billions of dollars that's being poured out into the enemy. I think it was one of the great, great summits, and I think it's going to have a profound effect on terrorism. [Applause]
Finally, because my administration is deeply committed to the right of religious believers everywhere to be free from persecution, I called on these leaders to protect Muslims, and Christians and Jews, and people of all things, because you know what's going on there, and it's horrible, horrible.
Terrorism a threat, and it is a big threat, to religious liberty around the world, and all responsible nations must protect the right of people to live and worship according to their conscience. [Applause]
Here in America, my administration is determined to work with you to protect your religious liberty, not just for some, but for everyone. Together, we can crush the horrors of terrorism. We can usher in a new era of faith, family and freedom, because we understand that a nation is more than just a geography -- a nation is the sum of its citizens, their hopes, their dreams, their values and their prayers.
America is a land rich with history and culture, and filled with people of courage, kindness and strength. And though we have many stories, we all share at home, the one thing we do share is one beautiful destiny. And whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood. [Applause] We all salute the same great American flag. [Applause] And we are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause]
We face many challenges. There are many hills and mountains to climb, but one by one, we will scale those summits, and we will get the job done and get the job done correctly. We will prove worthy of this very, very important moment in history. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions and faith in our God, then we will not fail. [Applause]
And as long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come, because we will make America great again. [Applause] Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. God bless you, everybody."
2017-06-02,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-june-2-2017,"My fellow Americans. I am thrilled to be back in the United States after our first historic foreign trip. Over the course of nine days, Melania and I traveled to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions, and met with nearly 100 foreign leaders.
Everywhere we went, my goal was to advance American interests, to build a coalition of nations to drive out the terrorists, and to unlock a future of peace, prosperity, and hope for all Americans, and people around the world.
In Saudi Arabia, I was honored to participate in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations, where King Salman and many other leaders expressed a desire to take on a greater role in defeating terrorists who murder innocents of all faiths.
At this unprecedented summit, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to a massive economic development deal that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States.
I also discussed the importance of the nations of the region taking more responsibility on migration, so that more young people are part of creating a better future in their home societies. From Saudi Arabia, I traveled to Jerusalem, where I reaffirm the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel.
There, I prayed at the Western Wall, visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and was awed by the majesty of that sacred land and the perseverance of the Jewish people. I also traveled to Bethlehem, another ancient city of wonder, where I met with Palestinian leader President Abbas. Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu assured me they are ready to reach for peace.
From Israel, I travelled to Italy, where Melania and I were greatly honored to visit the Vatican and meet Pope Francis. He was really wonderful, a great guy. Then I traveled to two summits with our key allies. First, the NATO summit in Brussels, where nations agreed they must do more to meet their financial obligations and pay their fair share, because right now, it is not fair to the United States, but it soon will be.
Next, I attended the G7 summit in Italy, where we worked to improve coordination on shared security threats, achieve more fair trade that gives workers a level playing field, and agreed on the goal that refugees should be resettled as close to their home countries as possible, so they could be part of the future rebuilding.
Before we returned home, I was delighted to conclude my trip by visiting American military families. Unbelievable people, the true source of our strength. We will always protect those who protect us.
Our first foreign trip was full of historic and unprecedented achievements. Joined by many old and new friends, we have paved the way for the new era of cooperation, one that calls upon each nation to take more responsibility to bring peace to their people.
One that works together to defeat the scourge of terrorism, and deliver hope to all of God's children. And one that protects American interests, so we remain a strong and prosperous nation. Strong and prosperous, like never before, and a beacon of freedom and opportunity for many years to come. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
2017-06-02,Remarks: Donald Trump Signs Two Law Enforcement Bills into Law,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-remarks-law-enforcement-bills-june-2-2017,"Thank you all. It's a great honor. And thank our vice president for being here. Ivanka Trump, thank you for being here. And we have a great group behind us, incredible people. Some of you have very good friends for a long time.
Good afternoon. It's an honor to be with you, the men and women of law enforcement, as well as two fantastic state Attorneys General, who are always proud to stand by the side of law enforcement officers. That's Pam Bondi and Leslie Rutledge, thank you very much, thank you.
I also want to thank also Chuck Canterbury, President of the Fraternal Order of Police, and Sheriff Greg Champagne, president of the National Sheriffs Association, where are you folks? Appreciate you being here. Really two great champions of law enforcement.
We are here today to reaffirm our unbreakable support for the American heroes who keep our streets, our homes and our citizens safe, and they've been doing an amazing job under very adverse conditions. We will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
I can speak very strongly for myself and for Mike Pence, our Vice President. We are behind you 100%. Every single day, Americans law enforcement officers, firefighters, first responders and their families make tremendous sacrifices for their communities, and for their nation.
When a home is threatened, when danger visits our doorstep, when innocent lives are on the line, Americans turn to their courageous offices of law enforcement, because we know they are here to serve and to protect us all.
They sacrifice every day to keep us safe. Many have paid the ultimate price, laying down their lives to save others. Incredible people. They're true heroes, and we will always be grateful. So I want to thank you folks, that is so true.
Our duty as Americans is to honor their service and sacrifice, and to protect those who protect us. Today, I am proud to sign two laws to help fulfill that very, very sacred commitment.
First the Public Safety Officers Benefits Improvement Act will help disabled officers and firefighters and families of those who fall in the line of duty quickly receive all of the benefit they so justly deserve.
People have wanted this for a long time, and I'm not just talking the people behind me. I'm talking about many people that represent the people behind me. Family members and friends, and people that just appreciate the work they do, which is incredible
For too long, injured officers have suffered, and the children the fallen officers have put their dreams of college on hold, while bureaucracy delayed crucial benefits, made it impossible for their families. No longer.
It's unacceptable, and is going to end today. In fact, it's going to end in about one minute. This bill speeds approval times by giving state and local enforcement greater role in determining eligibility, and lets applicants track the progress of their claims online.
So a much, much faster situation. You're all happy with that? [Audience says ""Yes Sir""] You order I'm talking about, right? You've been waiting for this for years.
Second, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act allows the use of federal grants to help our military veterans transition to new careers in law enforcement. America is proud of our veterans, and I think I can say we're double proud, or triple proud.
We love our veterans, and they're serving overseas. They're in harm's way. They are doing things that very few people would have the courage to do, and we will be and always will be incredibly proud to have them with us, and they've been with us like nobody, and we are going to be protecting them. They've been protecting us. We're going to be helping them right now.
They've really been with us in terms of freedom, in terms of our rights, and we're right now in terms their rights. As president, keeping Americans safe is my highest duty, and supporting law enforcement is my unwavering commitment. I am very proud to sign these two great bills today.
I want to thank everybody for being here, and if you have the bills we'll sign them. This has been years in the makin,g and I will tell you that this is something that I'm very happy to be doing. So congratulations everybody, Congratuations. [Audience says ""Thank you Mr. President""]
This Act may be cited as the Officers Public Safety Benefits Improvement Act of 2017. [Applause] That's a big one, right?
And this is, as you know, let it be an act of the United States House. This Act will be used The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, and that's what it is. You're heroes. And so, I want to just congratulate you. This one also has been a long time in the making, you're all heroes aren't you, I think? Yes?
That is fantastic, Who gets this pen, Mike? Who gets this pen? [Applause] Thank you very much everybody. This is slightly less controversial than yesterday, [Laughter] but yesterday was a big service to this country, I would tell you. Thank you very much everybody."
2017-06-01,Speech: Donald Trump Announces Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-paris-climate-accord-june-1-2017,"Good afternoon. Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, members of congress, distinguished guests, on behalf of the first family, welcome to the White House. [Applause] You know it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every day to make America great again.
Since the first day of this administration President Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people. President Trump has been reforming healthcare, enforcing our laws, ending illegal immigration, rebuilding our military and this president has been rolling back excessive regulations and unfair trade practices that were stifling American jobs.
Thanks to President Trump's leadership, American businesses are growing again, investing in America again, and they're creating jobs in this country instead of shipping jobs overseas. Thanks to President Donald Trump, America is back. [Applause]
And just last week, we all witnessed the bold leadership of an American president on the world stage putting America first. From the Middle East to Europe as leader of the free world, President Trump reaffirmed historic alliances, forged new relationships, and called on the wider world to confront the threat of terrorism in new and renewed ways.
And by the action the president will announce today, the American people and the wider world will see once again our president is choosing to put American jobs and American consumers first. Our president is choosing to put American energy and American industry first. And by his action today, President Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first. So with gratitude for his leadership... [Applause] ... and admiration for his unwavering commitment to the American people, it is now my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you the president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. [Applause]
Thank you very much. Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We're closely monitoring the situation. And I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time, but it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected. Before we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous, absolutely tremendous economic progress since election day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back and very, very rapidly. We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.
I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.
In my meetings at the G-7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that -- you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contributions.
One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president, whether it's cutting job- killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one, until this point, thought even possible. And believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.
On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments, and I don't want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... [Applause] ... thank you. Thank you -- but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an -- really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine. As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production.
Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally-determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.
Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.
This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need. Believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely -- they rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.
According to the same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper, down 12 percent; cement, down 23 percent; iron and steel, down 38 percent; coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86 percent; natural gas, down 31 percent.
The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have 7,000 less income, and in many cases, much worse than that.
Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscious support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does.
The world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.
Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does. And the mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand, new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try.
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it. India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs. It just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.
The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement. They went wild. They were so happy. For the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.
We have among the most abundant energy reserves in the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation, great wealth, phenomenal wealth. Not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth. And leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand. But at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country... [Applause] ... will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts. Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases. And the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.
Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree - think of that, this much - Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny - tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is an incredible statistic - would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030.
After we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes. As ""The Wall Street Journal"" wrote, this morning, ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate. The United States under the Trump Administration will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on earth.""
We'll be the cleanest. We're going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly but we're not going to put our businesses out of work, we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow. We're going to grow rapidly. [Applause]
And I think you just read - it just came out minutes ago the small business report. Small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people, one of the best reports they've seen in many years. I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its tax payers. [Applause]
So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our jobs. And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord and I think the people of sour country will be thrilled. And I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that we're out of the agreement.
I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issue. But under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wished to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement. It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm president, I'm sorry. [Applause]
My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on earth. And with the highest standard of living, and the highest standard of environmental protection.
Our tax bill is moving along in Congress and I believe it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone, but it's going very well.
The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do and I always will. [Applause]
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.
At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be. They won't be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. [Applause]
I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one, but now we're down to business.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called ""green climate fund"" -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments.
So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven't spent anything. And many of them will never pay one dime.
The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion. Nobody else is even close. Most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism. That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money.
And not good the way they took the money. In 2015, the united nations' departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog. In 2015, the green climate fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020, and nobody even knows where the money's going to. Nobody's been able to say, where is it going to? Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated.
America is $20 trillion in debt-cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers. Or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work, and yet under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.
There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world, should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. Economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives, thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty. [Applause] Our constitution is unique among all nations of the world. And it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will.
Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves. Which we have started. Very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.
The risks grow as historically, these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is just a starting point. As bad as it is. Not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty. And massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.
The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord. [Applause] And time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. [Applause]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. very much. [Applause]  Very important.
I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words. Scott, please?
Thank you Mr. President. Your decision today to exit the Paris accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first. And by exiting you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people. Please know that I'm thankful for your fortitude, your courage and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country. America finally has a leader who answers only to the people, not the special interests who had their way for way too long. In everything that you do, Mr. President, you're fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.
You're a cham... you're a champion for the hard working citizens, all across this land, who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interests. You have promised put America first in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to right-sizing Washington DC. And today, you put America first, with regard to international agreements and n the environment. This is an historic restoration of American economic independence, one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes.
With this action, we have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again. It should be noted that we as a nation to a better than anyone in the world, in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.
We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship. After all, before the Paris accord was ever signed, America reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s. In factm between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18+ percent. And this was corrected accomplished, not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of American private sector.
For that reason Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of the world does little. Other nations talk a good game. We lead with action. Not words. [Applause] Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation, to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint, to learn from us.
That should be our focus, versus agreed to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people. Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment, to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what's right by American people. You have that courage. And the American people can take comfort, because you have their backs. Thank you Mr. President.
Thank you."
2017-05-29,Speech: Donald Trump at the Memorial Day Ceremony at Arlington Cemetery,"Arlington, VA, United States","[-77.1067698, 38.8799697]",donald-trump-speech-memorial-day-arlington-may-29-2017,"Thank you so much. And thank you, General Dunford and Secretary Mattis, for your moving words and for your service to our great nation. Vice President Pence, Cabinet Secretaries, members of Congress, members of the Armed Forces and veterans -- thank you for joining us as we honor the brave warriors who gave their lives for ours, spending their last moments on this Earth in defense of this country and of its people.
Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage. We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind. Special, special people.
I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today. Incredible man. [Applause] I always like to call him General. He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war. Not only did Secretary proudly serve in the military for more than 40 years, enduring many hardships, but he and his incredible wife Karen have borne the single most difficult hardship of them all -- the loss of their son, Robert, in service to our country. Robert died fighting the enemies of all civilizations in Afghanistan.
To John, Karen, Heather, Kate, Andrea and the entire Kelly family, today 300 million American hearts are joined together with yours. We grieve with you. We honor you. And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us. Thank you, John. [Applause]
The Kelly family represents military families across the country who carry the burden of freedom on their shoulders. Secretary Kelly is joined today by his son-in-law, Jake, a Wounded Warrior. And the Secretarys son, Johnnie, will soon leave on his fifth deployment. It is because of families like yours that all of our families can live in safety and live in peace.
To every Gold Star family who honors us with your presence, you lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers. They each had their own names, their own stories, their own beautiful dreams. But they were all angels sent to us by God, and they all share one title in common -- and that is the title of hero. [Applause] Real heroes. Though they were here only a brief time before God called them home, their legacy will endure forever.
General Douglas MacArthur once said that"" ""the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind. Here at this hallowed shrine, we honor the noblest among us -- the men and women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom. We pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil. They made their sacrifice not for fame, or for money, or even for glory -- but for country.
We are privileged to be joined today by a man whose life demonstrates the values of service and sacrifice: Senator Bob Dole, here with his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole. [Applause] Senator Dole fought bravely in World War II, and was severely wounded by German fire. In just a few weeks, Bob will be celebrating his 94 th birthday. [Applause]
And, Bob, I know I speak for millions of grateful Americans when I say thank you. [Applause] Thank you, Bob. We thank you not only for your service, but for helping us to remember your fallen comrades and the countless American patriots who gave their lives in the Second World War.
Since the first volley of gunfire in the Revolution, brave Americans in every generation have answered the call of duty and won victory for freedom in its hour of need. Today, a new generation of American patriots are fighting to win the battle against terrorism -- risking their lives to protect our citizens from an enemy that uses the murder of innocents to wage war on humanity itself.
We are joined today by the wife of Specialist Christopher Horton, who rests on these so beautiful grounds. As Jane tells us, Chris was a man who loved his country with every part of his being.
In 2008, Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard. He trained as a sniper, becoming known as one of the best shots anywhere at any time. He was a talented, tough guy. While Chris was in the National Guard, he was also a volunteer police officer. In everything he did, he was thinking about how he could serve God, serve his family and serve his country.
In 2011, he deployed for the first time to Afghanistan. Chris knew his job was one of the most dangerous there was, but he was determined to go after the enemy at any cost to himself. His missions helped target and kill terrorists who sought to destroy innocent people. Just three months into his first deployment, Chris was near the Pakistan border, trying to eliminate an enemy cell that was doing so much damage and that was planting deadly roadside bombs against his unit and the units of many others. Standing watch with his comrades, he died in the ensuing gun battle with enemy forces. Chris sacrificed his life to protect his fellow soldiers -- and to protect all Americans. He was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his courage. At only 26 years old, Chris secured his place in our hearts for eternity.
Jane, America, grieves with you. Our whole entire nation sends you our support, our strength, and our deep, deep love. You lost your husband, and America lost a hero. And together, we will preserve his memory -- today, tomorrow, and always. Thank you, Jane. [Applause] Thank you, Jane. Thank you, Jane. [Applause] Thank you, Jane.
We are also joined today by David and Rose Byers, the parents of Major Andrew Byers. As a boy, Andrew dreamed of the chance to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. He worked hard, he earned that chance, and he graduated at the top of his class. He became the commander of a Special HALO team, leading his fellow soldiers out of aircraft, hurtling into dangerous and unknown territory.
About this time last year, Andrew was sent on his third combat deployment. This time he went to Afghanistan. On November 3 rd, he was one of 10 Special Forces operators to land by helicopter near a Taliban safe haven in northern Afghanistan. They trekked through a mile of waist-deep mud and climbed a steep cliff before finally reaching the village that they wanted to reach. There, a night-long battle ensued. Andrew and his team fought off wave after wave after wave of enemy fighters. A grenade detonated, and as the Taliban began to surround the American and Afghan forces, Andrew ran through the smoke and through the hail of bullets to rescue an Afghan soldier. In the midst of this torrent of gunfire and danger, Andrew worked heroically to open a gateway and get his men to safety -- risking his life to save theirs. And he did it. Unbelievably, he did. But in saving those lives, Andrew was killed right then and there by enemy fire. Andrew has since been awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in battle.
To his parents, David and Rose, we stand in awe of your son and his courageous sacrifice. On behalf of the American people, I express to you our everlasting gratitude for what your son did for his country, for his comrades, and for all of us.
Andrews father has said that he holds on to the promise of Joshua Chapter 1, Verse 9: The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] What a man he was.
To every Gold Star family, God is with you, and your loved ones are with Him. They died in wars so that we could live in peace. I believe that God has a special place in heaven for those who laid down their lives so that others may live free from fear and this horrible oppression.
Now let us pledge to make the most of that freedom that they so gallantly and brilliantly fought for and they died to protect. Let us also pledge to tell the stories of Robert, Chris, Andrew, and all of Americas fallen warriors today and for the next 1,000 years. [Applause]
And while we cannot know the extent of your pain, what we do know is that our gratitude to them and to you is boundless and undying. Boundless and undying. We'll always be there. Thank you. [Applause] Their stories are now woven into the soul of our nation, into the Stars and Stripes on our flag, and into the beating hearts of our great, great people.
Today we also hold a special vigil for heroes whose story we cannot tell because their names are known to God alone -- the unknown soldiers. We do not know where they came from, who they left behind, or what they hoped to be. But we do know what they did. They fought and they died in a great and noble act of loyalty and love to their families and to our country.
The letter written that is now famous -- one Civil War soldier captured it all and for all time. He wrote to his wife, If I do not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name. That is the love we hear whispering throughout this sacred place and from every tombstone on these hallowed grounds. It is the love that binds this earth beneath us and it bleeds from the hearts of all of those who died so that we might live free.
We can never replace them. We can never repay them. But we can always remember. And today, that is what we are doing -- we remember. Words cannot wipe away the tears or bring back those smiling faces. But if Americans just take the time to look into your eyes and tell you how much we thank you and how dearly we pray for you and how truly we love you, then hopefully you can find solace through your pain.
And every time you see the sun rise over this blessed land please know your brave sons and daughters pushed away the night and delivered for us all that great and glorious dawn. Thank you. God bless you. God bless our fallen heroes. God bless their families. God bless our military. And God bless the United States of America. [Applause]"
2017-05-27,"Speech: Donald Trump Addresses Military Personnel at NAS Sigonella, Italy",Italy,"[12.56738, 41.87194]",donald-trump-speech-military-nas-sigonella-may-27-2017,"What a beautiful place! [Applause] We had the greatest time here. We did a lot of great stuff. And I want to thank you very much. This has been an incredible trip, and great strides have been made. My husband worked very hard on behalf of our country, and Im very proud of him.
This trip has also been incredible for me as First Lady. In Saudi Arabia, I visited children at a local school and a call center with all-female employees. In Israel, I spent time with some children at Haddasah Medical Center along with Mrs. Netanyahu. In Rome, I was honored and blessed to be granted an audience with His Holiness, Pope Francis, followed by a very special visit to Bambino Gesu Children Hospital. Just hours after leaving, a young boy I spent time with found out he had received a new heart donor. Receiving that news is a moment I will never forget, and I wish him a speedy recovery.
In Brussels, I met with Queen Mathilda, and participated in a forum on preventing the online exploitation of children, then paid a visit to the patients at Queen Fabiola's Children Hospital. This trip, for me, has been very special and I will never forget the women and children I met. As one of the kids at the hospital that I visit said in a picture he drew for me: We are all the same.
I also want to take a moment to thank you all for the sacrifices you make on behalf of our country. It is because of your selfless commitment that we enjoy the freedoms we have today. And to the families who endure time apart, or constant moves to the base, your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Thank you and God bless you. [Applause]
And now it is my great honor to introduce my husband, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [Applause, Cheering]
I've got to get the lipstick off. Is it off? [Laughter] Thank you, honey. Thank you both. That's great. And I'm trying to figure out whos in that helicopter that is coming in. It may be Prime Minister Abe. It may be Justin from Canada. Great people. We made a lot of good friends this week, I'll tell you, a lot of good friends. Theyre good people.
America is very blessed with a lot of great diplomats. And I have to say this, as she just walks over here -- but I don't think the United States could possibly have a better emissary than our magnificent, and wonderful person, our First Lady, Melania. Thank you. Thank you, honey. [Applause] The countries of the world have a large number of disagreements, but they all agree with me on that one -- that I can tell you. So everywhere we go, it's the same old story. So, great job.
And you know, we've been gone for now a long time. Everywhere I go -- but we have been gone for close to nine days -- this will be nine days. And I think we hit a homerun no matter where we are. We're thrilled to be here right now. And we're getting on that very big plane -- we're heading back to Washington and the United States. But to be with you at our great naval air station is wonderful.
I can think of no better way to conclude our first foreign trip than to spend the time with you right here, with the incredible men and women of the United States Navy, and with all of our brave soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines -- (applause) -- and our great civilians -- we support them, right? [Applause] A very proud nation salutes you. A very, very proud nation. And I'll tell you what, we are very, very proud of you.
Every single day, you protect the safety and security of the American people -- and provide a symbol of hope, freedom and justice for the world. To our friends and allies, you are the ultimate reassurance -- to our enemies, you are the ultimate deterrent. Youre the metal spine forged out of the fires of American strength. And you notice how much stronger we're getting? Have you -- feeling it? Are you feeling it? [Applause] All that new equipment just coming in.
You saw what we did with our military budget -- way up. Took a little heat on that one, but it's okay with me. You are the men and women who make up the most powerful military in the world -- and under my administration -- as you know, you've seen it, right -- under my administration, stronger and stronger every single day. [Applause]
I want to thank Captain Brent Trickle for leading to prepare for this visit -- and you really have done a lot, I've seen it -- feel free to sound liberty call as soon as wheels are up. Okay? [Applause] That's sounds -- maybe I'll stay down with you and celebrate together this way. [Applause]
But before going any further, I also want to express, on behalf of the United States, our gratitude to our Italian and NATO allies here today. We have a lot of them. [Applause] Youre stationed at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, working side-by-side with Americans to confront the threats associated with the tremendous violence, suffering and instability across North Africa and the Middle East. To every service member from Italy, from a NATO country, we want to thank you for your friendship, and for partnering with us in the fight to defeat terrorism and protect civilization. [Applause] Better believe it.
Terrorism is a threat -- bad threat -- to all of humanity -- and together, we will overcome this threat. We will win. [Applause] But none of what we achieve would be possible without our wonderful military spouses and families. [Applause] Each of you makes these great sacrifices for our country as well. Lets hear it for the military spouses. [Applause] We will always support you and we will never, ever forget you. That I can tell you.
Theres one more very special group I have to thank, and that is our eighth grade students right here in Sigonella. Where are they? Oh, here they are. [Applause] I've been hearing a lot about you. In January, the eighth grade class at Sigonella came all the way from to Washington to march in my inaugural parade. Right? Look at you. Theyre all so happy. Young. You're going to have a great life, right? Great life. Thank you very much. I have to say. Are you all glad you did it? Thank you, honey.
It's an image I will always remember -- your smiling faces right out in front of the White House, carrying that great, big, beautiful American flag. Right? Thank you, kids. You traveled all the way from Italy to support my inauguration, so today I'm glad to be here -- and I traveled a long way to support you, and it's my honor. Thank you very much. [Applause] Military children also make great sacrifices for their country -- and I want you all to know that America is so proud of you.
As you know, I was here in Sicily to attend very important summit meetings -- the meeting of the G-7. It was a tremendously productive meeting, where I strengthened America bonds -- we have great bonds with other countries -- and with some of our closest allies. We concluded a truly historic week for our country.
Our travels took us to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions, and to gatherings of both America's oldest and newest friends. We traveled the world to strengthen longstanding alliances, and to form a new partnership among nations devoted to the task of eradicating the terrorism that plagues our planet. [Applause] And we've got the people who can do it, believe me. And I am now more hopeful than ever in the possibility that nations of many faiths and from many religions, and from many regions -- all over, all over -- can join together in a common cause.
The barbaric attack in Manchester -- and the massacre of innocent young lives -- underscores the depth of the evil we face, and the urgent need for us to join forces to absolutely and totally defeat it. [Applause] I met with Prime Minister May and expressed the absolute solidarity of the American people.
And just yesterday, Coptic Christians in Egypt were viciously gunned down in another vile terrorist attack, one that took the lives of beautiful Egyptian children and others. These murderous attacks grieve our souls -- but they also seal -- and I mean seal like in seal -- our resolve. Together, civilized nations will crush the terrorists, block their funding, strip them of their territory, and drive them out of this Earth.
My first visit during my travels took me to Saudi Arabia, where I had the honor of participating in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations -- hosted by King Salman, a wise leader who expressed his strong desire to work with the United States not only to confront terrorism but also the extremist ideology behind terrorism.
The nations of the Middle East have endured one terrorist attack after another -- and I called on them to take on the burden of fighting this evil that has killed so many innocent Muslims. During this unprecedented gathering, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to massive economic development deals, the likes of which there has never been, that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, building the equipment that has just been ordered by Saudi Arabia.
We also further isolated the Iranian regime over its hostile and destabilizing actions, and reaffirmed that Iran must never be allowed to obtain, under any circumstances, a nuclear weapon. [Applause] I was deeply encouraged to hear from the leaders of many Muslim and Arab nations that they are ready to take on a greater role in combating terrorism, and providing young Muslims in their region with a future of safety and a future of opportunity.
Next, I went to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed our unbreakable bond with the State of Israel. There, we continued our discussion about fighting terrorism, and crushing the organizations and ideologies that drive it. I went to the Western Wall, a monument to the perseverance of the Jewish people. I also prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and walked those sacred halls. I was awed by the majesty and beauty of that Holy Land, and the faith and reverence of the devoted people who live there. All children, from all faiths, deserve a future of hope and peace -- a future that does honor to God. [Applause]
I visited Bethlehem, a city so precious to so many, and met with the Palestinian leader, President Abbas. He assured me he is willing to reach for peace with Israel in good faith -- and I believe he will -- and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who assured me that he, too, was ready to reach for peace. Hes a friend of mine, and he means it.
From Israel, we came to Italy. In Rome, I was inspired by the beauty of Saint Peter's Basilica, and even more inspired by meeting with Pope Francis -- that great talk. It was truly a honor to meet the Pope, and to pray for peace on those hallowed grounds.
Then, I traveled to two summits with our key allies -- first at a NATO summit in Brussels, where we agreed to improve the burden-sharing among members of our Alliance, and to further confront the shared threat of terrorism. Other member nations must pay more. [Applause] The U.S. is currently paying much more than any other nation, and that is not fair to the United States or the United States taxpayer.
So we're working on it, and I will tell you, a big difference over the last year. Money is actually starting to pour into NATO from countries that would not have been doing what theyre doing now had I not been elected, I can tell you that. Money is starting to pour in. [Applause] It's only fair to the United States. We want to be treated fairly. And we're behind NATO all the way, but we want to be treated fairly. All of us will be more safe and secure if everyone fulfills their obligations the way theyre supposed to.
Right? Look at this man. Hes over there -- hes agreeing with me a hundred percent. Most people agree with it. Next, I attended the G-7 right here in Sicily, and made great progress toward , very vital goals. I laid out my vision for economic growth and fair trade in support of good-paying jobs, and even great-paying middle-class jobs, and more. And I called for much greater security and cooperation on matters of both terrorism, immigration, migration, to protect our citizens.
From Saudi Arabia, to Israel, to NATO, to the G-7, we made extraordinary gains on this historic trip to advance the security and prosperity of the United States, our friends and our allies. And we paved the way for a new era of cooperation among the nations of the world to defeat the common enemy of terrorism and provide our children with a much more hopeful future. You're going to have a great, great future. You're going to have a safe future because of your parents and other people in this room. [Applause]
That is why I knew I had to conclude my trip right here in Sigonella, with the dedicated service members who make the future so bright. So proud, because I'm am so proud of the future you're going to have. Are you all proud of the future you're going to have? You better believe it -- right? Dad, mom, we're all proud of it. We're all proud of it. We're proud of our country.
The men and women of the U.S. military have been the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world. I want you to know that you have a Commander-in-Chief who will never, ever forget. Never, ever. You will always be remembered number one. Just remember that. Always. [Applause] I will give you my complete and unshakable support.
We have already made a historic investment in defense spending -- youve been reading about it -- because we believe -- and you know this. Whats the expression? Peace through strength. Peace through strength -- right? Youll understand that when you get a little bit older. Peace through strength. And that's what we're going to have. We're going to have a lot of strength, but we're going to have a lot of peace. We will buy the planes, the ships, vehicles and equipment you need to get the job done -- and to come home safe and sound back to your families. [Applause]
I also know that the single greatest strength of our Armed Forces is you -- you, all of you -- the dedicated, really tough and really disciplined servicemen and women who bravely fight in our name. You not only know the pain of sacrifice, but you also know the tremendous rewards of military service -- of being part of something much larger than even yourselves. You know what it means to be part of a military team in which men and women are bound together in a sacred covenant of trust -- to serve together, to sacrifice together, and to fight together. And by the way, and to win together -- because you're going to win. You're going to do a lot of winning. [Applause] You're going to do a lot of winning. And my pledge to you is that we will always protect those who protect us. You are protecting us, and we will always remember that and we will always, always protect you.
Americans fought and died to liberate Europe from the evils of Nazism -- you know that -- and Fascism. American military power helped to free the world from the oppression of communism. And today, Americans like you are battling the sinister forces of terrorism throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the world. American military history is rich with noble traditions, harrowing missions, and selfless heroes -- like your parents. But, at its core, the moral of the story is always the same: It is the story of good overcoming evil.
You have poured out your hearts, your souls, and even your blood for this nation -- and we will pour out our gratitude to you in return. We will show our gratitude especially this Monday, on Memorial Day, when we pause to thank God for the heroes who have laid down their lives for our freedom. [Applause] Right?
Among those heroes was a young Navy sailor from Omaha. His name was John Joseph Parle. Parle enlisted in the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor, completed midshipman training at Notre Dame, and soon ended up not far from here, in the waters of the Mediterranean. On the night of July 9, 1943, Parle was among the tens of thousands of Allied forces preparing for a surprise landing the next morning on the shores of Sicily -- right here, about 70 miles away, to exact. It was to be a major allied offensive on European soil, and it was important.
On his ship, cloaked in darkness just six miles offshore, Parle noticed that a smoke screen device had caught fire in a small boat staged to support the landings. The boat was filled with explosives. He knew that if he didn't stop the fire, an explosion would light up the night sky, alert the enemy -- all of us fellow comrades would be killed, and the invasion would be a failure. So Parle rushed to the source of smoke, hardly able to breathe, breathing the smoke in, and without a thought for his own safety, picked up the burning device with his bare hands, ran to the side of the boat, and hurled it into the sea -- as far as he could throw.
In that decisive moment, Parle didn't hesitate. He acted. And in that act, he helped ensure the success not only in the savings of his friends and those lives, but of the Allied landing itself, which turned out to be a very, very important victory. So the Allied forces went on to win the Sicily campaign. Critical in their ultimate victory was Parle. But before that final victory, the young, brave, beautiful sailor who helped make it possible died from the smoke that had damaged his lungs so badly.
Ensign Parle had just turned 23. Yesterday would have been his 97 th birthday. For his brave actions, Ensign Parle was awarded the Medal of Honor. This Memorial Day, we remember him, and all the brave men and women like him, who give their last breath in defense of our country. We honor their memory and their sacrifice. And we also hope to honor them with our deeds -- to prove worthy of their sacrifice.
Because there is no peace without those willing to bear the scars and wounds of war. There is no strength without those brave enough to protect the weak and people that need protection. And there is no prosperity at home without those willing to shoulder our burdens overseas. That glorious American flag represents the blood of patriots spilled in defense of freedom. It represents the courage that burns in American hearts. It represents the unity that binds us all together as one. And it represents the freedoms bestowed on us by Almighty God.
You are the warriors of freedom. You are the protectors of that great American flag. You are the patriots who keep the fires of liberty burning. And you are the ones who protect the God-given freedoms that are the birthright of every single American child.
I am proud to be with you today as your Commander-in-Chief. I am honored to have had this time to spend with you. I am excited for the great adventures and achievements that all of us will accomplish together. May God bless you. May God bless our service members. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much."
2017-05-26,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Taormina, Italy",Italy,"[12.56738, 41.87194]",donald-trump-weekly-address-may-26-2017,"Each month families across the country work very, very hard to balance their budgets and to make the tough choices necessary to take care of their loved ones and to give their children opportunities they never had before. This is who we are as Americans -- we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited.
Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people. This has to change. We need a government that spends on the right things -- the safety, security, and well-being of our people -- and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas -- of which, perhaps, there are too many.
My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers.
We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy; it is growing already. It will grow faster than you've seen it in decades.
That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure.
At home, we are going to give our ICE officers -- who have done an incredible job -- and our Border Patrol agents -- who are amazing people -- everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all.
It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don't want MS-13 roving our streets, we're getting rid of them by the thousands, they're going to be out of here.
But I'm proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come. Thank you very much. You're going to love the end result."
2017-05-21,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the Arab Islamic American Summit,Saudi Arabia,"[45.079162, 23.885942]",donald-trump-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit-may-21-2017,"I want to thank King Salman for his extraordinary words, and the magnificent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting today's summit. I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived.
You also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader -- American President Franklin Roosevelt -- King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy -- and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens.
Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine.
I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith.
In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust.
Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperityÃin this region, and in the world.
Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God.
And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leadersÃunique in the history of nationsÃis a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce.
For Americans, this is an exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country: in just a few months, we have created almost a million new jobs, added over 3 trillion dollars of new value, lifted the burdens on American industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies -- many of whom are here today.
Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.
This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase -- and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a greater role in security operations.
We have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology -- located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World.
This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you.
America is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lectureÃwe are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership -- based on shared interests and values -- to pursue a better future for us all.
Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history's great testÃto conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism.
Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples.
With God's help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East -- and maybe, even all over the world.
But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks -- from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando.
The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. India, Russia, China and Australia have been victims.
But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim.
We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure.
The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams.
The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity.
This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock.
Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern onesÃincluding soaring achievements in architecture.
Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage.
All over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in Jordan. Iraq was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And the United Arab Emirates has reached incredible heights with glass and steel, and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art.
The entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home.
But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it.
Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith.
Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death.
If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killingÃthen not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God.
This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims -- we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy.
But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong -- and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden.
Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land.
America is prepared to stand with you -- in pursuit of shared interests and common security.
But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children.
It is a choice between two futures -- and it is a choice America cannot make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your Holy Land, and Drive them out of this Earth.
For our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not workedÃand will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests.
Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes -- not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms -- not sudden intervention.
We must seek partners, not perfectionÃand to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace -- not war. Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil.
Many are already making significant contributions to regional security: Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese Army is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U.S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country.
As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements.
I am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center -- co-chaired by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered.
I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hezbollah. Of course, there is still much work to do.
That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.
Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory -- piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be condemned. And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes don't kill innocents; they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development.
The United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for hearts and soulsÃand with the U.S., launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism.
I also applaud Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions.
That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life -- including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities.
For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once againÃand make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope.
In that spirit, after concluding my visit in Riyadh, I will travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and then to the Vatican -- visiting many of the holiest places in the three Abrahamic Faiths. If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible -- including peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all threeÃsafe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran.
From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.
Among Iran's most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime -- launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated.
Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. The Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders' reckless pursuit of conflict and terror.
Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve.
The decisions we make will affect countless lives.
King Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in America, its industry and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world.
This fertile region has all the ingredients for extraordinary success -- a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence.
We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice.
Today, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bringÃmore suffering and despair. But if we actÃif we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the worldÃthen there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have.
The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up millions of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear.
These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to fight together -- because united, we will not fail. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless the United States of America."
2017-05-19,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-may-19-2017,"My fellow Americans, This weekend I begin my first trip overseas as president a trip with historic significance for the American people.
I will be visiting with the leaders in many different countries to strengthen our old friendships, build new partnerships, and unite the civilized world in a fight against terrorism. In that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world's great religions.
My first stop will be Saudi Arabia the heart of the Muslim World. There, I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly.
Many of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran's role in funding both. Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region. Its about time we do it, well do it together, but it has to be done.
America cannot solve all of the world's problems, but we can and we must help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth.
Next, I'll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations. Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years we haven't always treated them that way. It's time to renew our friendship. While I'm there, I'll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
From there, I'll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis. I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace.
I will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the G-7 Summit in Italy. Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State Military serving their nation overseas. In my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all to always put American people first.
I also pledged that our partners must show that theyre partners, they must show that theyre friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost the money that were spending is so big; its so much; and its not fair for our nation. They have to help and Im sure they will. The fact is that I'm excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity and I hope you are too. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."

And John and all of his folks are also doing an incredible job protecting our homeland and our border. And I'm thrilled that my first address to the Service Academy is the graduation ceremony for the United States Coast Guard. Believe me, it's a great honor. [Applause] I've been here before and it's a very, very special place. Every cadet graduating today, as your Commander-in-Chief, it is truly my honor to welcome you aboard. [Applause] And you should take a moment to celebrate this incredible achievement.
Governor Malloy, thank you for being here. Governor, thank you. We're glad you could join us. And I know how busy the governors are nowadays, and they're out there fighting. It's never easy. Budgets are a little tight, but we're doing a job, all of us are doing a job, working together. I want to also thank Admiral Zookunft and his leadership. His leadership has been amazing. Today's graduates will be fortunate to serve under such capable and experienced Commandant. He really is fantastic.
Thanks also to Admiral Rendon, the Academy Superintendent. Admiral, I understand you come from a true Coast Guard family. Two brothers, a nephew, a cousin have all passed through these halls. That's very impressive. I guess you like the place, right? [Applause] Somebody in your family has been doing something right, I can tell you that. I'm sure they all are very proud, just as we are very proud of the fine young officers who are graduating today, Admiral, on your watch.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to all of the parents and the grandparents and family members who have supported these amazing graduates. Give your parents and everyone a hand. Come on. [Applause] Because America has families like yours, and we'll keep all of those families safe and very, very secure. You're keeping your families safe now.
If you are not already, you're about to become military families. So, starting today, I hope you feel the full gratitude of our nation. These fine young cadets are about to take their rightful place on the front line of defense for the United States of America. Cadets, you deserve not only the congratulations but the gratitude of each and every American, and we all salute you. [Applause] A proud nation. And you're a part of a very, very proud nation which salutes the 195 199 cadets of the Coast Guard Academy Class of 2017. Good job. [Applause]
And I understand from the admirals that this has been a very special class. You've been trained here to handle the toughest of situations, the hardest of moments really that you can experience, and the hardest in people's lives, and to help the weak in their hour of need. But even for the Coast Guard, this class has been exceptionally dedicated to public service.
You served breakfast at the local food bank every single weekday. You rebuilt a home with Habitat for Humanity. Last year, you led cadets in donating a total of 24,000 hours -- a lot of time -- to community service. You've done amazing work. And in the true Coast Guard fashion, you had fewer people and fewer resources, but you accomplished the objectives, and you did it with skill and with pride -- and, I'd like to say, under budget and ahead of schedule. We're doing a lot of that now in the United States government. [Applause] We're doing a lot of that.
I won't talk about how much I saved you on the F-35 fighter jet. I won't even talk about it. Or how much we're about to save you on the Gerald Ford, the aircraft carrier. That had a little bit of an overrun problem before I got here, you know that. Still going to have an overrun problem. We came in when it was finished. But we're going to save some good money. And when we build the new aircraft carriers they're going to be built under budget and ahead of schedule, just remember that. [Applause] That will allow us to build more.
Now, of course, there are always a few slip-ups from time to time -- you know that. For example, I understand that once or twice, First Class Cadet Bruce Kim -- where's Bruce? [Applause] Where's Bruce? Oh, Bruce, how do you do this to yourself, Bruce? [Laughter] As Regimental Parking Officer, might have accidentally caused a few tickets to be issued or a few of your cars to be booted. Bruce, what's going on with you? [Laughter]
But, Cadets, from this day forward, we want everyone to have a clean slate in life. That includes Bruce, right? [Laughter] And so, for any oversights or small violations that might have occurred this year, as tradition demands, I hereby absolve every cadet serving restrictions for minor offenses.
Now, Bruce -- stand up once again, Bruce. [Laughter] They saved you, Bruce, because they all wanted me to do that, okay? Thank you, Bruce. Congratulations, Bruce. [Applause] Good job. By the way, Bruce, don't worry about it. That's the tradition. I was forced to do that. You know that. Don't worry. [Laughter]
This is truly an amazing group of cadets that are here today for commission. You could have gone to school anywhere you wanted -- and with very, very few responsibilities by comparison. Instead, you chose the path of service. You chose hard work, high standards, and a very noble mission -- to save lives, defend the homeland, and protect America's interests around the world. You chose the Coast Guard. Good choice. Good choice. [Applause]
You've learned skills they don't teach at other schools right here on the grounds of this academy and also on your larger campus -- the open sea. That is a large, large campus, isn't it? A beautiful campus. But the greatest lesson you've learned at this proud institution is the knowledge you've learned about yourself. It's the knowledge that each and every one of you is something very special -- you are leaders.
From the first stormy days of your Swab Summer to your final weeks as a first class cadet, you have been expected to take responsibility, to make decisions, and to act. And I -- like all leaders, that's exactly what you have to do. You have to act, and you have to act properly. And you have to learn how to act under great, great pressure. You're all going to be under great pressure. You have to learn how to respond and to act under great pressure.
Just days from now, you will put this vital skill into the service of your ships, your sectors, and your country. You'll serve as deck watch officers on our amazing Coast Guard cutters. You'll bring law and order to the dangerous waters as boating officers. You will block illegal shipments of cash, weapons and drugs. You will battle the scourge of human trafficking -- something that people haven't been talking about. One of the big, big plagues of the world. Not our country only -- the world. Human trafficking.
Americans will place their trust in your leadership, just as they have trusted in generations of Coast Guard men and women, with respect for your skill, with awe at your courage, and with the knowledge that you will always be ready. You are Always Ready.
Not only will our citizens trust in your leadership, your commanders will trust you as well. The Coast Guard is the gold standard in delegating decision-making down to chain command. So just as your instructors have at the academy, your Coast Guard commanders will explain their vision, and then they will trust you to get the job done. Just like I, as your President, will also trust you to get the job done.
It's amazing to think of the adventures that are about to begin for you. Across the country this month, millions of other students are graduating high school, college. Many others are wondering, just what am I going to do. They're saying to themselves, what are they going to do. You know what you're going to do. Many, many students are graduating from college right now. They're saying, what am I going to do? Where am I going to go to work? You know it. You picked a good one, by the way. You picked a beautiful one, a good one, and we're really proud to have you, I can tell you. [Applause]
Years from now, some of them may look back and ask themselves whether they've made the right choice, whether they've made the most of the opportunities they've been given. In the Coast Guard, you will face many challenges and many threats, but one thing you will never have to face is that question of what will I do. When you look back, you won't doubt. You know exactly how you spent your time -- saving lives.
I look at your admirals, I look at General Kelly, I look at some of the great people in service, and I want to tell you, they're excited about life. They love what they do. They love the country. They love protecting our country, and they love what they do. Is that right? Good. I didn't think anyone was going to say no. [Laughter] That would have ruined our speech, right? [Laughter] They're great people. You always know just what you'll be: the leaders and officers of the United States Coast Guard. [Applause]
And when they see your uniform, everyone in the world will know exactly what that means. What standard -- and really if you think of it, when you talk about the great sailors, and the great sailors of the world, we have them. But what stranded sailor doesn't feel relief when those red racing stripes break the horizon? What drifting soul at sea, with only a short time left to live, doesn't rejoice at the sound of those chopper blades overhead, coming back and coming down to rescue them from death? What poison-peddling drug runner, the scourge of our country, doesn't tremble with fear when the might of the Coast Guard comes bearing down on them? In each case, we know the reason -- America's lifesaving service is on the way. The Coast Guard is truly vital to the United States Armed Forces and truly vital to our great country. [Applause]
Out of the five branches of our Armed Services, it's only the Coast Guard that has the power to break through 21 feet of rock-solid Arctic ice, right? You're the only ones. And I'm proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years. We're going to build many of them. [Applause] We need them. We need them.
The Coast Guard stands watch at our ports, patrols our waterways, and protects our infrastructure. You defend America in a world of massive and very grave threats. Soon, some of you will be leading boardings of suspicious vessels, searching for the most deadly weapons, and detaining criminals to keep our people safe. Others of you will work with partners in scores of countries around the globe, bringing in the full power of the United States Coast Guard right up to those distant shores. And some of those shores are very far away.
To secure our borders from drug cartels, human smugglers, and terrorist threats, Coast Guard Cutters patrol more than 1,500 miles below our southern border. A lot of people didn't know that. When enormous pride hits your heart, you realize that it's with this great skill and tremendous speed, our Coast Guard men and women interdict dangerous criminals and billions and billions of dollars' worth of illegal narcotics every single year. Your helicopters launch from the decks of world-class national security cutters, and they chase drug smugglers at speeds far in excess of 50 knots.
In rough seas, at high speeds, our incredible Coast Guard snipers take their aim at the smugglers' engines. And time after time, they take out the motors on the first shot. They don't like wasting the bullets, right? [Applause] They actually don't. Your slice through roaring storms, and through pouring rain and crashing waves is a place where few other people will ever venture -- exciting. Exciting. But you have to have it in your heart. You have to love it. You love it.
In the Coast Guard, you don't run from danger, you chase it. And you are deployed in support of operations in theaters of conflict all around the world. But not only do you defend American security, you also protect American prosperity. It's a mission that goes back to the earliest days of the Revenue Cutter Service. You've read about that and studied that.
Today, the Coast Guard helps keep our waters open for Americans to do business. It keeps our rivers flowing with commerce. And it keeps our ports churning with American exports. You help billions and billions of dollars in goods to navigate our country every day. You are the only federal presence on our inland waterways. You police the arteries we need to rebuild this country and to bring prosperity back to our heartland. And we are becoming very, very prosperous again. You can see that.
Think of the glorious mission that awaits. You will secure our harbors, our waterways, and our borders. You will partner with our allies to advance our security interests at home and abroad. And you will pursue the terrorists, you will stop the drug smugglers, and you will seek to keep out all who would do harm to our country -- all who can never, ever love our country. Together, we have the same mission, and your devotion and dedication makes me truly proud to be your Commander-in-Chief. [Applause] Thank you.
Now, I want to take this opportunity to give you some advice. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted. But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never, ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine.
Look at the way I've been treated lately -- [Laughter] -- especially by the media. No politician in history -- and I say this with great surety -- has been treated worse or more unfairly. You can't let them get you down. You can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams. [Applause] I guess that's why I -- thank you. I guess that's why we won.
Adversity makes you stronger. Don't give in. Don't back down. And never stop doing what you know is right. Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. And the more righteous your right, the more opposition that you will face.
I've accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time as President. Jobs pouring back in to our country. A brand-new Supreme Court justice -- who's going to be fantastic for 45 years -- [Applause] -- a historic investment in our military. Border crossings -- thank you to our General -- are down more than 70 percent in just a short period of time -- a total record, by the way, by a lot. [Applause] We've saved the Second Amendment, expanded service for our veterans -- we are going to take care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before. [Applause]
I've loosened up the strangling environmental chains wrapped around our country and our economy, chains so tight that you couldn't do anything -- that jobs were going down. We were losing business. We're loosening it up. We've begun plans and preparations for the border wall, which is going along very, very well. We're working on major tax cuts for all. We are going to give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country if we get it the way we want it, and we're going to give you major tax reform. [Applause] And we're also getting closer and closer, day by day, to great healthcare for our citizens. [Applause]
And we are setting the stage right now for many, many more things to come. And the people understand what I'm doing, and that's the most important thing. I didn't get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests. I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that's what I'm doing. [Applause] I will never stop fighting for you, and I will never stop fighting for the American people.
As you leave this academy to embark on your exciting new voyage, I am heading on a very crucial journey as well. In a few days, I will make my first trip abroad as President. With the safety, security, and interests of the American people as my priority, I will strengthen old friendships and will seek new partners -- but partners who also help us. Not partners who take and take and take, partners who help, and partners who help pay for whatever we are doing and all of the good we're doing for them -- which is something that a lot of people have not gotten used to and they just can't get used to it. I say, get used to it, folks. [Applause] I'll ask them to unite for a future of peace and opposition opportunity for our peoples and the peoples of the world.
First, in Saudi Arabia, where I'll speak with Muslim leaders and challenge them to fight hatred and extremism, and embrace a peaceful future for their faith. And they're looking very much forward to hearing what we -- as your representative -- we have to say. We have to stop radical Islamic terrorism. [Applause]
Then in Israel, I'll reaffirm our unbreakable alliance with the Jewish state. In Rome, I will talk with Pope Francis about the contributions of Christian teachings to the world. Finally, I'll attend the NATO Summit in Brussels and the G7 in Sicily -- to promote security, prosperity and peace all over the world.
I'll meet scores of leader, and honor the holiest sites of these three great religions. And everywhere I go, I will carry the inspiration I take from you each day, from your courage and determination to do whatever is required save and protect American lives. Save and protect American lives. We want security. You're going to give us security. [Applause]
In just one example, we see how priceless that gift of life is to the people you touch every day. A few years ago, a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue swimmer took off in the direction of three terrified fishermen who clung to their sinking and burning vessel. That day, our Coast Guard heroes did their jobs well. They flew over the sea, despite tremendous danger, and extended a helping hand at the moment it was most urgently needed. There was very little time left.
But that's not the most remarkable part of that story. As one Coast Guard swimmer put it, you do that stuff all the time. You do it every hour of the day. Something is happening all the time with the United States Coast Guard. You do an amazing job. A remarkable thing happened with that rescue, but when you think of it, you do those rescues all the time. There, the Vietnamese fishing captain grabbed the swimmer's hand. He looked his Coast Guard rescuer in the eye, and said: ""I was asking God to please let me live....I need to see my kids. Please, God, please, let me live so that I can see my kids. Then God sent me you."" That's what he said. [Applause]
To every new officer, and to every new Coast Guard member here today, or out protecting life around the world on some of the roughest waters anywhere, you truly are doing God's work. What a grateful heart you must all have. Because it is with my very grateful heart, and America's cheers for the Coast Guard -- and America cheers for you often -- but we wish you good luck.
As your Commander-in-Chief, I thank you. I salute you. And I, once again, congratulate the Coast Guard Class of 2017. [Applause] God bless you. God bless the Coast Guard. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Good luck. Enjoy your life. [Applause]"
2017-05-15,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the National Peace Officers Memorial Service,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-peace-officer-memorial-may-15-2017,"Thank you, everybody. [Applause] Wow, what a beautiful introduction. Thank you, Chuck. That was above and beyond. That's the way I'm going to be with you, too. And it's a great honor -- thank you very much -- it's a great honor to address America's heroes on this most solemn occasion. Words cannot express the depths of our gratitude, but I hope that our actions will show you how deeply we care and how strongly we feel about protecting those who protect us. America stands strong with our men and women in blue. Believe me, we stand strong together.
I want to recognize Jim Pasco, Linda Hennie, Chaplain Wiggins, and everyone at the Fraternal Order of Police for all that you do to protect the law enforcement of this country and all of our communities. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause] As long as I'm President, you will always find an open door to the White House. And you've already found it, believe me.
Mr. Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and members of Congress, we are gathered here today at the U.S. Capitol to pay tribute to those brave law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty. On this Peace Officers' Memorial Day, we thank God for having blessed so many of us with such incredible heroes -- and we pledge our solidarity with their families and loved ones. And many of those great families and survivors are here with us today, and I'd love you to stand up. Families and survivors -- what great, incredible people. [Applause] And your loved ones are looking down on you right now, believe me, and they're very proud. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much for being here. Whatever you need, we are here for you, and we are praying for you.
As I look out today at this amazing assembly of police, detectives, marshals and sheriffs, I want to make all of you remember and heed this promise: I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement as much as you have always supported me. And you did, big league. [Applause] Your presence here reminds us all of what is at stake on this sacred day of remembrance. Each May, during Police Week, new names of fallen police officers are added to the National Law Enforcement Memorial. This year, 394 brave souls join the over 20,000 men and women who gave up their lives in the line of duty to protect us.
The names of these heroes are not only carved into that wall, but carved into the hearts of the American people. And by the way, the American people love you, more than you will ever know. I can tell you that. [Applause] Though your loved ones left us much too soon, the memory of their courage will live on forever. To see so many names together is to gain only a small glimpse of the debt America owes to those who protect our cities and police on our streets.
We are privileged this morning to be joined by families of the fallen, to whom we owe that ultimate loyalty. So many people -- even back here. Please know that you do not grieve alone. Though we cannot fathom the depths of your loss, nor fully appreciate the bond that forms in the precinct and between partners on the beat, your sadness is left and felt by all of us. Every drop of blood spilled from our heroes in blue is a wound inflicted upon the whole country. And every heartache known by your families in law enforcement is a sorrow shared by the entire family of the American nation.
No one asked these selfless men and women to enlist in this righteous cause, or to enroll as foot soldiers in the eternal struggle against crime and violence. They joined the cause because their hearts were big and full of amazing courage. They joined because they cared so deeply for the innocent and helpless and forgotten. They put on the uniform because they believed to the very core of their souls, that it was their mission in life to serve and to protect.
As the Bible tells us, there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. The names and stories on that wall are each a testament to this pure and unselfish love. And that's what it is -- pure and unselfish love. And it is our duty as a people and as a nation to prove worthy of their sacrifice. And that begins with showing our police the appreciation they have earned a thousand times over. [Applause]
Living in New York, I gained a deep appreciation and lasting admiration for law enforcement. Thousands of people are living and enjoying life today in New York who otherwise would be gone because our great police fought to bring safety to our streets and our communities. The entire world witnessed the heroism of New York's finest when they gave their lives on 9/11 -- I was there -- and sacrificed so much in that brutal, horrible aftermath.
Now, as President, my highest duty is to keep America safe. We will keep America safe. [Applause] And included in safe means safe from crimes, safe from terrorism, and safe from all enemies, foreign and domestic. At the center of that duty is the requirement to ensure that our law enforcement personnel are given the tools and resources they need to do their jobs and to come home to their families safely. [Applause]
You are the Thin Blue Line between civilization and chaos. You come from every community and all walks of life. You are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. You rush into unknown danger, risking your lives for people you have never met, people you don't know, performing your duty under the most difficult conditions -- and often without any thanks at all.
Because you do not hear nearly enough, I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police. [Applause] And a very sad thing is that many of today's politicians don't want to say that, don't want to talk about that because it's not politically correct or they think it might hurt them with the voters. I will say it and I will talk about it proudly. [Applause] I will make it the personal priority of my administration to ensure that our police are finally treated fairly, with honor and respect that they deserve. [Applause]
To all Americans watching this event today, next time you see a cop on the beat, take a moment to say two wonderful words, which they so readily deserve: Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
As you all know much too well, we are living through an era in which our police have been subject to unfair defamation and vilification, and, even worse -- really, I mean, you see what's going on, you see what's going -- even worse, hostility and violence. More officers were slain last year in ambushes than in any year in more than two decades, including -- and that's so incredible to even have to be speaking about this -- the beloved officers killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in yet another murderous attack of law enforcement. And we have some of those incredible families and survivors with us. [Applause] Thank you.
The attacks on our police are a stain on the very fabric of our society, and you are entitled to leadership at the highest level that will draw a bright line in the sand -- not a red line in the sand that isn't gone over -- but a bright line in the sand. And we will protect you. That I can tell you. And we will say, ""Enough is enough."" [Applause] The attacks on our police must end, and they must end right now. [Applause]
And just to show you, by the way, how much I love our police, I said, oh, I'm going to need a hat because it's so windy today. [Laughter] I said, when I got out of here, there's no way I'm going to put on this hat. So we'll leave off the hat. And this is for you, Micah. That's for our beautiful Micah down there. [Applause] We must also end the reckless words of incitement that give rise to danger and give rise to violence. It is time to work with our cops, not against them, but to support them in making our streets safe; not to obstruct them -- which we're doing, we obstruct them.
It is time for all Americans, from all parties and beliefs, to join together in a simple goal to ensure that every child in America has the right to grow up in safety, security and peace. True social justice means a future where every child, in every neighborhood, can play outside without fear, can walk home safely from school, and can live out the beautiful dreams that fill their heart -- like you, Mica. [Applause]
Freedom includes the right to be free -- and I mean totally free -- from crime and from violence. MS-13 is going to be gone from our streets very soon, believe me. [Applause] When policing is reduced, it's often the poorest and most vulnerable Americans who are the first to suffer. We have all seen the tragic rise in violence and crimes in many of our disadvantaged communities. We've seen the unbearable horror of the shortcomings in Baltimore and Chicago that have cut short so many lives and so many beautiful, beautiful dreams.
We cannot stand for such violence. We cannot tolerate such pain. We cannot, under any circumstances, any longer turn a blind eye to this suffering that's going on any longer. And we won't. [Applause]
It's time for a grateful nation to join hands with our police and with our sheriffs to build the bridges of cooperation and trust, and to make our streets safer for every man, woman and child in America. And someday, many of the young children you are protecting will decide that they, too, want to be police officers, that they, too, want to be sheriffs, they want to be cops -- they want to be cops. They want to protect people because they love people. And that's what they're going to do, and they're going to do it well. They're going to be great at it.
As we seek this better and brighter future, we do so in the memory of these brave but gentle souls who were stolen from this world when they had so much left to share and to give not only to us but to their incredible families.
Among them were Patrolman Justin Martin and Sergeant Tony Beminio, who were murdered last November. Patrolman Martin was on the beat for less than a year, and leaves a beautiful, loving mom and dad, Randy and Jane. And thank you, Randy and Jane. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Sergeant Beminio was a veteran of 11 years, and leaves behind his wife Zoe, and his wonderful children, Cameron, Haley and Maddox.
Ashley Gwin-Don of the Prince William County Police fell in the line of duty on her very first day on the beat. She swore the oath to protect and serve only a day prior to her death. One day. Officer Gwin-Don was dedicated to serving our nation
-- she also served in the Marines. And today, our thoughts are with her and her incredible mother, Sharon. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you. Thank you, Sharon. [Applause] Thank you.
I also had the privilege to meet at the White House just a little while ago with representatives from the Phoenix Police Department, New Jersey State Troopers, and the Ulster County Sheriff's Department, who are mourning the deaths of State Trooper Frankie Williams and Sergeant Kerry Winters. I had the chance to spend time with Officer Glasser's beautiful family, his wife, Kristen, and his six-year-old son Micah -- who has my hat and he's now with us. Micah, stand up. Kristen, please stand up. Great people. [Applause]
Kristen and Micah, I know your beloved husband and father is looking down on you right now from heaven, and he is so proud of you both. And thank you very much. Thank you. We also remember those incredible heroes who were so cruelly targeted for execution in Dallas, Texas -- rushing into a hail of gunfire, never to return. Dallas Police Sergeant Michael Smith was a 27-year veteran of the Dallas Police. He was decorated a law enforcement officer at the highest level, and even paid his own way to attend advanced training sessions. He leaves behind his cherished wife, Heidi, and his loving daughters, Victoria and Caroline. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]
Last Friday, in Kirkersville, Ohio, a gunman shot and killed Steven Eric Disario. He was the Chief of the Kirkersville Police Department. He died responding to a hostage situation at a local nursing home. Chief Disario leaves behind six children and his wife, who is expecting another child. Our hearts break for the Chief's family. We love you all. We love you all. [Applause] Thank you.
To every child in America who has lost a mom or a dad in the line of duty, I want you to know your parents are American heroes -- American heroes. They died keeping us safe. They are the pride of our nation. And we will hold them in our hearts always and forever. [Applause] Their sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten. To everyone in the audience here today, I want you to know that my administration is determined -- totally determined -- to restore law and order and justice for all Americans, and we're going to do it quickly. [Applause]
And that is why I'm so proud to be here today with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Director John Kelly, two men who are deeply committed to the rule of law, to the rank-and-file officers who enforce it, and to bringing the violent criminals, drug dealers, and gang members to justice. And I mean bring them to justice quickly. Thank you very much for being here. [Applause]
All of you at this ceremony, the men and women who police the streets, or who send our loved ones to work with a really very, very, sometimes worried or heavy heart -- every single day you do that -- you've seen and you've heard things that no one else should ever have to see or hear. You bear this burden on our behalf. You have witnessed the evil of those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain on the innocent. You've seen a lot of that more recently than maybe ever before. It's going to stop. And you've watched great, great people suffer unthinkable harm and unthinkable death.
America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them. We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals. We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else. [Applause] And we owe it to them to build a better future for all of America's wonderful children.
May today be the beginning of a new era of respect and appreciation for law enforcement. May this ceremony bring new hope to those in search of healing, harmony and peace. May Americans learn from the example of the heroes we have lost, and always remember to trust each other, work with each other, and love each other. And finally, and so importantly, may God bless you. May God bless our police. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-05-13,Speech: Donald Trump Receives an Honorary Doctorate at Liberty University,"Lynchburg, VA, United States","[-79.14224639999999, 37.4137536]",donald-trump-commencement-address-liberty-university-may-13-2017,"Thank you very much. everybody. And congratulations to the class of 2017. That's some achievement. This is your day and you've earned every minute of it. And I'm thrilled to be back at Liberty University, I've been here, this is now my third time, and we love setting records, right. We always set records. We have to set records, we have no choice.
It's been a little over a year since I've spoken on your beautiful campus and so much has changed. Right here, the class of 2017 dressed in cap and gown, graduating to a totally brilliant future. And here I am standing before you as President of the United States, so I'm guessing Ã there are some people here today who thought that either one of those things, either one, would really require major help from God. Do we agree? And we got it.
But here we are celebrating together on this very joyous occasion, and there is no place in the world I'd rather be to give my first commencement address as President than here with my wonderful friends at Liberty University. And I accepted this invitation a long time ago. I said to Jerry that I'd be there, and when I say something I mean it.
I want to thank President Jerry Falwell and his incredible wife, Becky, stand up, Becky, for their kind words, their steadfast support, and their really wonderful friendship. Let me also extend our appreciation to the entire Falwell family, Trey, Sarah, Wesley, Laura, and Caroline, thank you for everything you do to make this university so exceptional, one of the truly great, great schools.
Most importantly to our new graduates: Each of you should take immense pride in what you have achieved. There's another group of amazing people we want to celebrate today and they are the ones who have made this journey possible for you, and you know who that is? Nobody, you forgot already. You're going to go out, you're going to do whatever you're going to do, some are going to make a lot of money, some are going to be even happier doing other things Ã they're your parents and your grandparents, don't forget them. You haven't forgotten yet, have you? Never, ever forget them, they're great.
And especially this weekend, let's make sure we give a really extra special thanks to the moms. Don't forget our moms, because graduates, today is your day. Today is your day. But in all of this excitement don't forget that tomorrow is Mother's Day, right? I had a great mother, she's looking down, now but I had a great mother. I always loved Mother's Day.
We're also deeply honored to be joined by some of the nearly 6,000 service members, military veterans and military spouses who are receiving their diplomas today. Will you please stand. Please stand. Wow. That's great. Thank you very much, great job. We're profoundly grateful to every single one of you who sacrificed to keep us safe and protect God's precious gift of freedom. It is truly a testament to this university and to the values that you embrace that your graduating class includes so many patriots who have served our country in uniform. Thank you very much.
To the class of 2017: Today you end one chapter but you are about to begin the greatest adventure of your life. Just think for a moment of how blessed you are to be here today at this great, great university, living in this amazing country, surrounded by people who you love and care about so much. Then ask yourself, with all of those blessings, and all of the blessings that you've been given, what will you give back to this country and, indeed, to the world? What imprint will you leave in the sands of history? What will future Americans say we did in our brief time right here on Earth? Did we take risks? Did we dare to defy expectations? Did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems? I think I did, but we all did and we're all doing it.
Or did we just go along with convention, swim downstream, so easily with the current and just give in because it was the easy way, it was the traditional way or it was the accepted way? Remember this, nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right Ã and they know what is right, but they don't have the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it. It's called the road less traveled.
I know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth, will be a warrior for our country, and for your family. I know that each of you will do what is right, not what is the easy way, and that you will be true to yourself, and your country, and your beliefs. In my short time in Washington I've seen firsthand how the system is broken. A small group of failed voices who think they know everything and understand everyone want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think. But you aren't going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you're right.
And those of you graduating here today, who have given half a million hours of charity last year alone, unbelievable amount of work and charity and few universities or colleges can claim anything even close, we don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives. I'm standing here looking at the next generation of American leaders. There may very well be a president or two in our midst. Anybody think they're going to be president, raise your hand.
In your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice and devotion. Now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action. America has always been the land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers. When the pilgrims landed at Plymouth they prayed. When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator four times, because in America we don't worship government we worship God. That is why our elected officials put their hands on the Bible and say, 'So help me God,' as they take the oath of office. It is why our currency proudly declares, 'In God we trust,' and it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God every time we say the pledge of allegiance.
The story of America is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams and humble beginnings. That is also the story of Liberty University. When I think about the visionary founder of this great institution, Reverend Jerry Falwell Sr., I can only imagine how excited he would be if he could see all of this and all of you today, and how proud he would be of his son and of his family.
In just two days we will mark the 10th anniversary of Reverend Falwell's passing, and I used to love watching him on television, hearing him preach, he was a very special man. He would be so proud not just at what you've achieved but of the young men and women of character that you've all become. And Jerry, I know your dad is looking down on you right now and he is proud, he is very proud, so congratulations on a great job Jerry.
Reverend Falwell's life is a testament to the power of faith to change the world. The inspiring legacy that we see all around us in this great stadium Ã this is a beautiful stadium and it is packed. I'm so happy about that. I said, 'How are you going to fill up a place like that?' It is packed, Jerry. In this beautiful campus and in your smiling faces but it all began with a vision. That vision was of a world class university for evangelical Christians. And I want to thank you, because boy did you come out and vote, those of you that are old enough, in other words your parents. Boy oh boy, you voted, you voted.
No doubt many people told him his vision was impossible, and I am sure they continued to say that so long after he started, at the beginning with just 154 students, but the fact is no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can't be done. Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they're people that can't get the job done. But the future belongs to the dreamers, not to the critics. the future belongs to the people who follow their heart no matter what the critics say because they truly believe in their vision.
At Liberty your leaders knew from the very beginning that a strong athletic program would help this campus grow so that this school might transform more lives. That is why a crucial part of Reverend Falwell's vision for making Liberty a world-class institution was having a world-class football team much like the great teams of Notre Dame, great school, great place, in fact, Vice President Mike Pence is there today doing a fabulous job as he always does.
A few years ago, the New York Times even wrote a story on the great ambitions of the Liberty Flames. That story prompted a longtime president of another school to write a letter to Jerry. It's a letter that Reverend Falwell would have been very, very pleased to read. Jerry tells me that letter now hangs in the wall in the boardroom of your great university. It came from the late Father Theodore Hesper, who was the beloved president of the university of Notre Dame 35 years ago.
Like this school's founder, he was a truly kindhearted man of very, very deep faith. In the letter, Father Hesper recalled that Notre Dame's own meteoric rise from a small Midwestern school to a national football powerhouse. And then he wrote something so amazing and generous. He wrote, 'I think you are on that same trajectory now and I want to wish you all the best and encourage you from the starting and from being able to start very small and arriving in the big time.'
Thanks to hard work, great faith, and incredible devotion those dreams have come true. As of February of this year, the Liberty Flames are playing in the FBS, the highest level of competition in NCAA football. Don't, don't clap, that could be tough. Don't clap. That could be tough. I'm a little worried. I don't want to look at some of those scores here. Jerry, you sure you know what you're doing here? Those other players are big and fast and strong but I have a feeling you're going to do very well, right?
From the most humble roots you've become a powerhouse in both education and sports. And just wait until the world hears the football teams you'll be playing on your schedule starting next season. President Falwell gave me a list of some of those schools, the ones you're going to be playing 2018. Would you like me to read the names? Just came out, would you like to hear them? I'm a little bit concerned. UMass, Virginia, Auburn Ã Jerry, are you sure you know what you're doing? Jerry, Auburn?
I don't know about that James. This could be trouble, Jerry. Rutgers, Old Dominion, Brigham Young, Army Ã I might be at that game, who am I supposed to root for? Tell me. I don't know. That's a tough one, Jerry. I don't know, Jerry, I'm going to have to think about that one, Jerry. Buffalo, Troy, Virginia Tech, oh no, Jerry, Ole Miss and wake forest, those are really top schools. maybe in four or five years I'll come to a game, right, you'll build it up. Well good luck.
The success of your athletic program arriving on the big stage should be a reminder to every new graduate of just what you can achieve when you start small, pursue a big vision and never, ever quit. You never quit. If I give you one message to hold in your hearts today, it's this. Never, ever give up. There will be times in your life you'll want to quit, you'll want to go home, you'll want to go home perhaps to that wonderful mother that's sitting back there watching you and say, 'Mom, I can't do it. I can't do it.' Just never quit. Go back home and tell mom, dad, I can do it, I can do it. I will do it, you're going to be successful.
I've seen so many brilliant people, they gave up in life, they were totally brilliant, they were top of their class, they were the best students, they were the best of everything, they gave up. I've seen others who really didn't have that talent or that ability and they're among the most successful people today in the world because they never quit and they never gave up. So just remember that. Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you.
Carry yourself with dignity and pride. Demand the best from yourself and be totally unafraid to challenge entrenched interests and failed power structures. Does that sound familiar by the way? The more people tell you it's not possible, that it can't be done, the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the word 'impossible' as nothing more than motivation. Relish the opportunity to be an outsider. Embrace that label Ã being an outsider is fine, embrace the label Ã because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference. The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward.
And always have the courage to be yourself. Most importantly, you have to do what you love. You have to do what you love. I've seen so many people, they're forced through lost of reasons, sometimes including family, to go down a path that they don't want to go down, to go down a path that leads them to something that they don't love, that they don't enjoy. You have to do what you love, or you most likely won't be very successful at it. So do what you love.
I want to recognize a friend who is here with us today, who can serve as an inspiration to us all. Someone who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. Real champion. A true, true champion. Both on the field, off the field, he's a Hall of Fame quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, really a good friend of mine, an amazing guy, Jim Kelly, where is Jim, he's here some place. Where is Jim, stand up, Jim. What a great man. Jim Kelly, he was tough. Jim do you have any idea how much money you'd be making today? They'd hit Jim, it was like tackling a linebacker. They'd hit Jim, four guy, five guys that weighed 320, and he'd just keep going down the field. He was much more than a quarterback. He had tremendous heart and he knew how to win. Jim is tough, and his toughest fight of all was that he beat cancer not once but twice.
And I saw him and his incredible wife as they were in a very low moment, Jill, very, very low moment, and it was amazing the way they fought. It didn't look good, I would have said, maybe, maybe it's not going to happen. But there was always that hope because of Jim and Jim's heart. But I want to just say it's great to have you here today Jim and these people are big, big fans and if you can get a young version of Jim Kelly, you'll be beating a lot of teams, Jerry.
So, interestingly, though, I said 'I wonder what Jim's doing here,' his daughter Erin crosses the goal line to you and today with you so, Erin, stand up. Where are you, Erin? Where is Erin? Congratulations, Erin. Congratulations. Graduating from Liberty. Great choice, thank you.
Liberty University is a place where they really have true champions and you have a simple creed that you live by: To be, really, champions for Christ. Whether you're called to be a missionary overseas, to shepherd a church or to be a leader in your community, you are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope and love. And I must tell you I am so proud as your president to have helped you along over the past short period of time. I said I was going to do it, and Jerry, I did it. And a lot of people are very happy with what's taken place, especially last week, we did some very important signings, right James? Very important signings.
America is better when people put their faith into action. As long as I am your president, no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what's in your heart.
We will always stand up for the right of all Americans to pray to God and to follow his teachings. America is beginning a new chapter. Today each of you begins a new chapter as well. When your story goes from here, it will be defined by your vision, your perseverance and your grit. That's a word Jim Kelly knows very well, your grit. In this, I'm reminded of another man you know very well and who has joined us here today.
His name is George Rogers, Liberty University CFO and vice president for a quarter of a century. During World War II, George spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war. He saw many of his fellow soldiers die during the Bataan death march. He was the victim of starvation and torture as a prisoner of war. When he was finally set free he weighed just 85 pounds and was told he would not live past the age of 40. Today George is 98 years old.
Great. That's so great, George. If anyone ever had reason to quit, to give in to the bitterness and anger that we all face at some point, to lose hope in God's vision for his life, it was indeed George Rogers. But that's not what he did. He stood up for his country, he stood up for his community. He stood up for his family and he defended civilization against a tide of barbarity, the kind of barbarity we're seeing today and we've been witnessing over the last number of years and I just want to tell you as your president, we are doing very, very well in countering it, so you just hang in there. Things are going along very, very well. You'll be hearing a lot about it next week from our generals Things are going along very, very well.
Through it all, he kept his faith in God, even in the darkest depths of despair. Like so many others of his generation, George came home to a nation full of optimism and pride and began to live out the American dream. He started a family, he discovered God's plan for him and pursued that vision with all his might, pouring his passion into a tiny college in a place called Lynchburg, Virginia. Did you ever hear of that? Lynchburg? We love, we love it. Do you like it? We like it, right? I flew over it a little while ago. It's amazing, actually. What started as a dream with a few good friends he helped shepherd into the largest Christian university in the world. Just look at this amazing, soaring, growing campus and I've been watching it grow because I've been a friend of Liberty for a long time, now, Jerry. It's been a long time.
Thanks in great part George's financial stewardship hundreds of thousands of young hearts and souls have been enriched at Liberty and inspired by the spirit of God. George, we thank you, and we salute you, and you just stay healthy for a long time, George, thank you.
Now it falls on the shoulders of each of you here today to protect the freedom that patriots like George earned with their incredible sacrifice. Fortunately you have been equipped with the tools from your time right here on this campus to make the right decisions and to serve God, family and country. As you build good lives, you will also be rebuilding our nation. You'll be leaders in your communities, stewards of great institutions and defenders of liberty and you will be great mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers, loving friends and loving family members.
You will build a future where we have the courage to chase our dreams no matter what the cynics and the doubters have to say. You will have the confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and to express the love that stirs your souls. And you will have the faith to replace a broken establishment with a government that serves and protects the people.
We must always remember that we share one home and one glorious destiny whether we are brown, black or white. We all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same great American flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as you remember what you have learned here at Liberty, as long as you have pride in your beliefs, courage in your convictions and faith in your God, then you will not fail.
And as long as America remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens, and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come, I can promise you that. This has been an exceptional morning. It's been a great honor for me and I want to thank you, the students. I also want to thank you, the family, for getting them there ,and I want to thank and congratulate Liberty. May God bless the class of 2017. May god bless the United States of America. May God bless all of you here today. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you."
2017-05-12,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-may-12-2017,"My fellow Americans, confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many many years. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly 10 years last month, and we created 211,000 new jobs. Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans, who at this time of the year are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma certificate or commission. So important, and we're so proud of them. This weekend, I am delighted to be participating firsthand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates.
I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I'll be away at the G7, and I look forward to that, and we'll be at West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy. Come to think about it, a few days later I'll actually travel to New London Connecticut to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country. So we'll be with them very shortly.
To young Americans at both school, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our nation's bright future. That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force. We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learned the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape and supply this nation.
The people who construct repair and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run, and lots of those people voted for me. That's also why, in my administration, I'm so deeply committed to technical and vocational education. I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages and disappearing jobs. We are ending the sellout of American workers and lifting the burdens on American industry manufacturing and business.
We're also rolling back job-killing regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America at the same time. We're unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil, and just off our shores. On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of high-paying jobs that can support a middle-class family, and in fact most families.
As a vote of confidence, in these policies, business optimism is soaring and employment is rising. These are great signs for America's future the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country. I want every young citizen regardless of education or geography to be able to live out their American Dreams.
So to all of America's graduates congratulations and to all of America's youth we are here to help create the jobs and future you de-serve. The brightest days are ahead of you, and I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy and at Liberty University. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-05-05,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-may-5-2017,"My fellow Americans. Since day one, my administration has been hard at work tearing down the barriers to job creation and economic growth. We have removed one job-killing regulation after another. They're not pretty, and they're going, and believe me: we are just getting started on regulations. Dear God.
On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called Obamacare, perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, Obamacare is collapsing. The House bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster and replace it with more choices and more freedom for American families.
Most importantly, it will be great health care and your premiums will come down and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better health care at a lower cost. And now I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing Obamacare will be a big, big win for the American people.
Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher, and we're bringing them down, and I mean way down. I'm proposing, actually, the single largest tax cut in American history. Now tax relief will be focused on the middle class, including much-needed relief for low and middle-income parents raising children.
As we provide tax relief for working families, we must also stop crippling American industry. Right now, America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries, and believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it.
We want to turn our country into a jobs machine, a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brand new beautiful business. And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15%, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth, and we're not going to allow it any longer.
Along with our historic tax cut, we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.
The complexity of the tax code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is. It's an army of lawyers, and lobbyists, or accountants. Other people can do it. You can't and it's not fair to ask you to even think about it.
That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy. Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on tax day. They were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe everyday Americans know better how to spend their own money than the federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can.
Tax reform, along with regulatory relief, and fair trade deals -- and we're going to make them fair, but even really good again for our country and for our workers -- all of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America, and bring wealth, hope and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.
Together, we are going to fight for every last American job, and we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers, and so good for our families. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America."

Thank you so much. Great honor. And thank you to my very good friend Rupert Murdoch. there's only one Rupert, that we know. But for helping to keep this history alive -- and he's been working on this for a long time he loves Australia -- and for the next generation.
And thanks also to the legendary talented golfer, Greg Norman. I used to think I was a great player, and then I played with Greg one time and I said, well I'm not going to play golf for a living. He saved me a lot of time, I'll tell you that. And thank you to everyone here tonight for helping us to honor and remember those very brave souls who answered the call of freedom.
Also to Anthony Pratt, who just pledged two billion, and that's peanuts for Anthony, if you know Anthony [Laughter]. Come on Anthony, you can do better.
Thank you, thank you very much Anthony. That's beautiful. It's really a special privilege to be back on the Intrepid and to address both American and Australian heroes. Melania and I are thrilled to be joined by a very, very special Prime Minister and his wonderful wife, Lucy, who have just gotten to know. And, you know, they said had a rough phone call.
We really didn't have a rough phone call, did we? Everyone's talking about this phone call. The media was saying, what do you think about the phone call, you didn't really hang up? No, we had actually a very nice call, right?  Good, now the record is straight.
All of those people back there. Thank goodness. [Laughter, Applause] It's true. We had a very nice phone... it got a little testy... got a little bit testy, but that's okay. We've had a very good relationship, and I'm very proud of the relationship. Thank you very much, Malcolm.
The Prime Minister and I have just finished a productive discussion about the interests of our two countries. Together we discussed crucial issues, ranging from national security to trade, to immigration and enhanced economic cooperation
We reaffirmed the tremendous friendship between the United States and Australia, and the vital importance of our security and our alliance. The Armed Forces of our two nations are operating side-by-side almost every day, fighting to defeat ISIS and the scourge of terrorism and we will eradicate terrorism. [Applause]
Every man and woman who has served America and Australia in uniform, two proud Nations salute you, believe me. There is no better place to remember the importance of military readiness than this ship. It was laid down just one week before the tragic -- and the tragedy -- of Pearl Harbor, and helped secure freedom in its hour of need.
I was proud to share the news that this week, my administration reached a historic deal with Congress to end the devastating cuts to the United States military. [Applause] I don't know what they were thinking when they started cutting, but we've got it all coming back, in big league, believe me. It's coming back fast. Ordering lots of planes, lots of ships, lots of jobs too, by the way.
We will add more than 25 billion dollars for national defense in a short period of time, and we will ensure that our service members have the equipment, tools, training, and resources that they need and that they so richly deserve. [Applause]
But security also requires friends that you can truly count on. That is why I was pleased to meet with Prime Minister Turnbull, and why I'm so glad to be here with you tonight. And we had a great meeting just a little while ago.
I want to thank the American-Australian Association for hosting this event, which I've been contributing to by the way for years through Rupert. Every year, he'd send me this letter, could you please give money? I said what do I have to do with that Rupert? And I just keep sending him money, money and now I realize that was money well spent. That's right, right Rupert? For years, I've been I've been doing my thing for Rupert, and for his decades of work to strengthen the ties between our two countries, they've done a great job.
America and Australia are old friends, and really natural partners, and with your help we will remain so for a very, very long time to come. [Applause] Our two nations were born as the rebellious children of the same parent. [Laughter] It's a very interesting statement. I've heard that before about people.
And for nearly a century Americans and Australians have fought together, bled together, and died together as brothers and sisters. Since the first World War, when Australians let Americans in the Battle of the Hamel, our brave warriors have fought shoulder to shoulder in every major conflict together. Their righteous cause has always been the same: the safety of our citizens, and the survival of our freedom.
From the beaches of Normandy -- a vicious, vicious fight -- to the jungles of Vietnam and the desert landscapes of the Middle East, where lots of progress, believe it or not, after all these years, is being made -- Americans have had no better friends than the Australians. I mean that. [Applause]
We are proudly and profoundly grateful for Australia's contributions in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and their help in the fight against terrorism following the terrible attacks of September 11th. On behalf of the United States, I thank the Australian people tonight. Believe me, I have so many friends here from this country, and we love Australia -- all of us. We really love Australia, thank you very much.
I know there are many active duty service personnel from both nations with us in the audience, and I want to express our gratitude to each and every one of you. We are privileged to be joined by many amazing veterans from our two countries, as well -- and for really from so many different conflicts, there are so many conflicts that we fought on and worked on together -- and by the way in all cases succeeded on -- it's nice to win.
It's nice to win, and we've won a lot, haven't we Mr. Prime Minister? We've won a lot. We're going to keep it going, by the way. You've given your love and loyalty to your nations, and tonight a room of grateful patriots says thank you. We are especially honored by the presence tonight of seven World War II veterans, and we've been talking about them all night, but I should mention their names once again, perhaps for the final time tonight, or we can keep mentioning them, because they're worth it. And their names again: John Hancock, Derick Holyoke, Gordon Johnson Norm Tame, Wendell Thrasher, Roger Spooner, and Bill White. Great, great people. [Applause]
These men stood at the breach in the battle to save civilization, and their sacrifice kept us free. Exactly 75 years ago this week, these men saw that historic battle with their own eyes, and we've also covered that very, very vicious, violent battle.
But this is a little bit of a different description. But the end result was the same. We won. We won. They saw enemy planes flying toward them by the dozen. They saw the flames erupt into the air, and they saw the true cost of war in the faces of the heroes that never returned.
On this special gathering, on this special night we remember the courage of these men, and every man -- Australian and American -- who fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea. [Applause]The count of the dead goes on and on, and the number of wounded do not even begin to describe the toughness of the fight, and their incredible sacrifice. But perhaps, in the story of just one man, we can hope to get a small glimpse of its measure.
It is the story of Lieutenant Jack Powers, a Navy flier. He grew up just miles from here, in a modest apartment in Washington Heights, right up the road. He then went on to the United States Naval Academy, incredible place.
There, his roommate said of Jack: never trust him to respect conventionalities, because he wasn't a conventional person, to put it mildly. He's a hilarious rebel, and his own man. You'll like him, and really like him a lot. But you know what, he's just a different kind of a guy. In other words, he was a New Yorker. [Laughter] By the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jack had already served six years in the Navy.
In the six months that followed, the Allies suffered many defeats and many, many casualties. Japan captured footholds all across the Pacific, and now was closing -- and really fast -- closing in on Australia.
In May, 1942, the invasion fleet moved on Port Moresby, the vital base just a few hundred miles from Australian shores. It was there, off the coast, that American and Australian ships met the enemy in the Coral Sea. On the morning of May 7th, Jack Powers launched his Dauntless dive bomber from the depth, and deck of the Yorktown. He was some flyer, I can tell you that. Some great flyer.
Soon he dives straight at an enemy carrier, and dropped his bomb so low, he was almost caught in the blast, and he was badly hurt. But he escaped, and the carrier sank. That night on the Yorktown, Jack urged the other pilots to take the same risk. He said, that's the way you do it. That's the way you win. That's the way you sink them. Whatever the cost, even if it costs you your lives, that's the way you sink the ship.
The next morning, he pressed this point again. Remember, he said, the folks back home are counting on us. I'm going to get a hit if I have to lay it down right next to that flight deck. In their courage, they turned the tide of the Pacific War. They had tremendous success. They were knocking out ship after ship.
That day Jack flew his plane to another carrier, straight into a hail of oncoming lead and fire, to land a devastating blow on its deck. Seconds later, the colossal blast -- the one Jack was talking about and saying we have to take the risk -- engulfed his plane and Jack was gone. He was dead.
He was brave, but what a job he did. Some time before Jack died, he sent a wire home to his father in New York. It read: Dear dad, 1,000 miles away doesn't make any difference. Your bad son is thinking of you, hoping that he is worthy of being called a chip off the old block. His father was a tough cookie also.
Now it is we who are thinking of Jack, and all those brave souls who fought along side of him, with that incredible form of attack, and especially those who found their final resting place beneath the waters where they waged that greatest of battles. They lost their lives in the fires of war, but gained immortality through their sacrifice. And now, 75 years later, we hope that we are worthy of their deeds in the beautiful, beautiful Coral Sea.
We hope to be worthy of the sacrifices made by every service member who has fought in our name, past and present. The men who fought the Second World War saw terrible things, horrible things, deathly things. But they also witnessed spectacular valor and bravery, and from the record of that horrible war, they rebuilt their nations and launched civilization to new heights.
They knew that together, free people can achieve extraordinary things, and that one hero can make all of the difference in the world. In those Pacific waters, we forged iron bonds between our two countries. Few peoples in the world share ties in history, affection and culture like the Americans and the Australians.Few, believe me. [Applause]
Those ties were sealed with the blood of our fathers and grandfathers, and those same ties are now the priceless heritage we celebrate so beautifully tonight. So with love for our two nations, with pride in our shared history, and with faith in Almighty God, we renew our old friendship, and we pledge our lasting partnership in the search for prosperity and everlasting peace. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.
I'm honored that you're here. I'm honored that Mrs. Turnbull is here, and I'm honored that everybody in this room is with us to realize what a great, great relationship our two nations have together. God bless you. God bless our fallen heroes. God bless the Australian people, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause]"
2017-04-29,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","Harrisburg, PA, United States","[-76.8867008, 40.2731911]",donald-trump-speech-rally-harrisburg-pa-april-29-2017,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. It is truly great to be back in the wonderful, beautiful state of Pennsylvania. [Applause] I love this state, and I love the people of this state. It is special, and it carried us to a big, beautiful victory on November 8. [Applause] I want to recognize some of our friends that have helped us so much. Congressman Scott Parent, GT Thompson, a couple of my originals, Mike Kelly, who I watched on television.
He was great. Where is Mike Kelly? Where is he? Boy, were you great on television this morning. And of course, one of our other originals, Congressman Tom Marino. Right? [Applause] Thank you, thank you. As you may know, there is another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington DC. Did you hear about it? [Booing] A large group of Hollywood actors -- [Booing] -- and Washington media -- [Booing] -- are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in the nation's capital right now.
They are gathered together for the White House Correspondent's Dinner -- without the President. [Applause] And I could not possibly be more thrilled that to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you, and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people. Right? [Applause]...
USA, USA, USA.
And look at the media back there. They would actually rather be here, I have to tell you. [Booing] That's right.
[Inaudible]
Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news. Fake news. [Booing] And they are sitting -- and they are wishing -- in Washington. They are watching right now, they are watching, and they would love to be with us right here tonight. [Applause] but they are trapped at the dinner, which will be very, very boring. But next year, maybe we will make it more exciting for them in Washington and we'll show up. But we have a good chance of showing up here again next year, too. [Applause]
The truth is, there is no place I would rather be than right here in Pennsylvania to celebrate. [Applause] -- our 100-day milestone, to reflect on an incredible journey together, and to get ready for the great, great battles to come, and that we will win and every case. Ok? We will win. [Applause]
Because make no mistake, we are just beginning in our fight to make America great again. [Applause] Now before we talk about my first 100 days, which has been very exciting and very productive, let's rate the media's 100 days. Should we do that? Should we do it? [Booing]
Because as you know, they are a disgrace. According to a Morning Consult call, more than half of Americans say the media is out of touch with everyday Americans. They've proven that. [Applause] According to Media Research Center, 89% of the media's coverage of our administration has been negative and purposefully negative, and perhaps -- [Booing] -- that's because according to the Center for Public Integrity, 96% of journalists who gave donations gave them to our opponent. And does anyone were member who our opponent was?
Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.
That was some opponent. Finally, according to a poll last year from the Associated Press, only 6% of Americans have a lot of confidence in America. That is very bad. That is much lower than Congress, by the way. But I will give you an example of something really incredible. [Protestor is escorted out] That's right. Get them out of here. Get them out. [Applause] ...
USA, USA, USA.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Do we love our law enforcement or what? [Applause] And I want to thank the fire marshals. They have a lot of people standing outside. We really maxed out. We broke the all-time record for this arena. How old is this arena? We broke the all-time record. I don't have a guitar, which is pretty tough. So, ust as an example of media, take the totally failing New York Times. [Booing]
Pretty soon they will only be on the internet. The paper is getting smaller and smaller. Do you ever notice? It is starting to look like a comic book. It's getting... But I will tell you, because I watched, and I used to be in the real estate business, they sold their beautiful New York Times building in Manhattan, a cathedral to journalism. Such a beautiful, beautiful building. For around $130 million, and the group that bought it later sold it for approximately $500 million.
Now they live in a very ugly office building in a crummy location. Next, they buy The Boston Globe newspaper, with lawsuits ,for $1.3 billion and invest millions and millions of dollars to get it going. In the end, they sell it for zero. They give it away. And then they write nasty editorials and op-ed telling me how I should be handling world events. [Booing] But that is what we have. They are incompetent, dishonest people who after the election, had to apologize because they covered it, us me, so badly that they felt they were forced to apologize because their predictions were so bad.
Do you are member their prediction? -- Do you remember their production? They lost a lot of people because of the way they covered. So here's the story. If the media's job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree the media deserves a very, very big, fat, failing grade. [Booing] Very dishonest people. And not all of them. You we call it the fake news. Now -- we call it the fake news. Now everybody is using the word fake news.
Where did you hear it, folks? By contrast, for the last 100 days, my administration has been delivering every single day for the great citizens of our country, whether it is putting our coal miners back to work, protecting America's steel and aluminum workers -- we love that steel and aluminum -- or eliminating job killing regulations, we are keeping one promise after another, and frankly, the people are really happy about it.
They see what is happening. [Applause] But to understand the historic progress we have made, we must speak honestly about the situation that we and I inherited because, believe me, the previous administration gave us a mess. [Booing] For decades, our country has lived through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. You people know it better than anybody in Pennsylvania. Our factories were shuttered. Our steel mills close down, and our jobs were stolen away and shipped far away to other countries, some of which you have never even heard of.
Politicians send troops to protect the borders of foreign nations, but left America's borders wide open for all to violate. [Booing] We have spent billions and billions of dollars on one global project after another, and yet, as gangs flooded into our country, we couldn't even provide safety for our own people. Our government rushed to join international agreements where the United States pays the cost and bears the burden while other countries get the benefits and pay nothing. [Booing]
This includes deals like the one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Where the United States pays billions of dollars while China, Russia, and India have contributed and will contribute nothing. [Booing] Does that remind you of the Iran deal? How about that beauty? On top of that, it is estimated that full compliance with the agreement could ultimately shrink America's GDP by $2.5 trillion over a 10-year period. That means factories and plants closing all over our country.
Here we go again. Not was me, folks. [Applause] Those are the facts, whether we like them or not. The dishonest media won't print them, won't report them because the Washington media is part of the problem. Their priorities are not my priorities, and they are not your priorities, believe me. [Applause] Their agenda is not your agenda. I will be making a big decision on the Paris Accord over the next two weeks. [Applause]
And we will see what happens. But they are all part of a broken system that has profited from this global theft and plunder of American wealth at the expense of the American worker. We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore because, from now on, it is going to be America first. [Applause] and I have to -- ...
USA, USA, USA.
And I have to just interject because, as you know, I have been a big critic of China. And I have been talking about currency manipulation for a long time. But I have to tell you, during the election, number one, they stopped. But more importantly, just to show you the dishonesty -- we have currency manipulation by China -- but China is helping us possibly or probably with the North Korean situation. Ok? It's a great thing. [Applause] and I met with the President of China at great length in Florida. We had long, long talks. Hours and hours and hours. He's a good man.
He's representing China, not us, but he's a good man. And I believe he wants to get that situation taken care of. They have tremendous power, and we will see what happens. But the media said Donald Trump refuses to name China a currency manipulator. Think of this. We have to have a little flexibility. So I meet with the President of China and say, could you help us out with North Korea? You give them 93% of their different materials they need in their food.
You have a lot of power. We have a great relationship. Then the media says, why didn't he call Donald Trump, and why did Donald Trump in the meeting say you are a currency manipulator? So here's the story. Listen, Mr. President, will you help us out with North Korea? But by the way, you are manipulating your currency. It doesn't work, right? So, So... [Laughter] You understand. So instead of saying that, let's see what happens. I honestly believe he is trying very hard. Not an easy situation for China, believe me.
Not an easy situation. But we have somebody there who is causing a lot of trouble for the world. We have China, who is really trying to help. As you have seen, they have set back vast amounts of coal coming to North Korea. So let's see what happens. I think it is not exactly the right time to call China a currency manipulator right now. Do we agree with that? [Applause] But they never say that. So I promise you in my inaugural address 100 days ago that now arrives the hour of action. And believe me, we've started from day one, that is what we have delivered. 100 days of action. Those people and others are exhausted. They've never seen anything like that.
They've never seen anything like this. [Applause] We are ending the off-shoring and bringing back our beautiful, wonderful, great American jobs. [Applause] We are eradicated the criminal gangs and cartels that have infiltrated our country. You are reading about them all the time. Some of you have big problems with them. Thank you for that sign, Blacks for Trump. I love that guy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, man. That is great. That is really cool. I appreciate it.
And we are taking steps to renegotiate or cancel any agreement that fails to protect American interests. Here are just some of our great achievements from the first 100 days. And I will tell you, in addition to that, we have built such a strong foundations with the leaders of foreign countries, and we are set to rock. But we have great relationships with Germany and Japan and China and so many others The U.K. -- such great relationships. That is part of the process.
We have appointed and confirmed a brand-new justice of the United States Supreme Court. [Applause] Justice Neil Gorsuch, who will uphold the constitution and the right of Americans to govern their own affairs, and the last time a new Supreme Court Justice was confirmed in the first 100 days was 136 years ago in 1881, and I was devastated to hear that because I thought I would be the only one to have done that. [Applause] It was a long time ago.
To protect our jobs and economic freedom, I immediately withdrew the United States from the horrible, disastrous, would have been another NAFTA, but worse, Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause] That would have taken your jobs in Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. That was a total hoax. The TPP what have been a tremendous disaster for our country, and we are not going to surrender Pennsylvania jobs ever again. We have done that once before. It is not going to happen. [Applause] we have just launched an investigation into foreign steel dumping and aluminum dumping throughout our country.
We are reviewing every single trade deal, and wherever there is sheeting, we would take immediate action, and there will be penalty. [Applause] And we have with us tonight Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and one of the great, great people on fair trade and good trade, Mr. Peter Navarro. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] And we will renegotiate NAFTA, and if we don't get a good deal and a fair deal for our country -- and I have been saying for a long time we will either renegotiate or terminate -- I announced the other day we were going to terminate, everybody said we would terminate -- two people I like very much, the President of Mexico and Prime Minister of Canada, called up and said, can we negotiate? I said yes, we can renegotiate.
So we will start a renegotiation, and hopefully it will be fair for everybody. And if it is not a fair deal for our country -- because you have to understand, we have been on the wrong side of the NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico for many, many years. Many decades. We can't allow it to happen. So we are going to renegotiate, and if we can't make a fair deal for companies and workers, we will terminate NAFTA. Ok? [Applause]
Our directives will let brand-new Pennsylvania steel into the spine of America. [Applause] We've ordered billions and billions of dollars in unpaid duties to be collected at the border from countries that break the rules, and that just started. It is going to be a lot coming in. [Applause] We just want fairness, and I followed through on my promise and issued a new government directives to buy American and hire American. [Applause] In just these first few months, we have created 99,000 new construction jobs, 49,000 new manufacturing jobs, and 27,000 new mining jobs. Who are the miners here? Finally we are taking care of our miners. We love our miners.
And we have over 600,000 new jobs. And by the way, the stock market since our election -- [Applause] -- is through the roof. I believe from the point of the election -- isn't it too bad that the Obama administration gets a lot of credit for those few months? But it's all right. [Booing] They get credit with -- get credit for it. We have an all-time record for the biggest increase in the stock market. So I am very happy about that. [Applause] We have removed the shackles on energy exploration imposed by the last administration, lifting the restrictions on the production of oil, shale, and natural gas.
And very importantly for Pennsylvania, we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and we are putting our coal miners back to work. [Applause] we love our miners. I am also very pleased to say that we have finally cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access piplines. [Applause] 48,000 new jobs. They couldn't get their approvals. We got them their approvals in 24 hours one day. -- 24 hours, one day. I want to tell you, the heads of those two companies didn't know what the hell happened. They said, how did this happen?
They should go to bed and say their prayers. But that is going to be approximately 48,000 jobs. My administration has also scrapped a job killing regulation that was threatening our auto workers. We want more cars made in the USA, and that is going to happen. [Applause] We have created a new rule which requires that for every one new regulation, to old regulations -- two old regulations must be eliminated. And we have signed massive executive orders clearing up the environmental bureaucracy. We are going to have jobs, and you're seeing them already. We have also been very busy on the legislative front, which we have got no credit for, and yet I am signing away.
I have signed 29 new bills, a record not surpassed since the Truman administration. [Applause] This includes 13 resolutions to eliminate intrusive federal regulations, the most ever signed in our history. In keeping our promise to our veterans, I have signed legislation to extend veterans choice, and the head of the veteran's administration is here with us tonight, David Chilton. He did an incredible job. We have increased by 42% the approval for veterans using the Choice program. I have also created an office of accountability at the VA. Our message to federal workers is clear: If you fail our veterans, you will be held accountable. [Applause]
To create accountability across government, I have issued a five-year ban on federal officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. Good? [Applause] I have got a lot of people in my staff that are not exactly happy with that one, but that is ok. And I have issued a lifetime ban on federal officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. [Applause] I have imposed these bans for a simple reason.
It is time to drain the swamp. [Applause] and that is what we are doing in Washington DC. Perhaps in no area have passed governments sold out since the -- sold out special interest in foreign lobbyists than on the issue of immigration. Year after year, you pleaded for Washington to enforce our laws as illegal immigration surged, refugees flooded in, and lacks vetting -- and lax vetting threaten to your safety and security. And don't worry, we are going to have the wall. Don't worry about it. [Applause] ...
Build that wall, built that wall, built that wall.
We have done so well at the border, a lot of people are saying, wow, maybe the President doesn't need the wall. We need the wall to stop the drugs and human trafficking. We need the wall. In just 100 days, we have taken historic steps to secure our border, imposed needed immigration control like you have never seen before -- is that true? And properly screened and vet those seeking admission into our country. They are going to come in because they love our country.
We are not taking them otherwise. We are operating on a very simple principle that our immigration system should put the needs of American workers, American families, American companies, and American citizens first. [Applause] I have appointed a great military general, John Kelly, to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Since my election, we have already achieved an unprecedented 73% reduction in illegal crossing on our southern border. [Applause]
The greatest reduction in the history of our country, and we just started. The world is getting the message. If you try to illegally enter the United States, you will be caught, detained, deported, or put in prison, and it will happen. [Applause] As I campaigned across the nation, I met with the grieving mothers and fathers of children who had been killed, viciously killed, violently killed by a legal immigrants.
And I made them a promise. We will protect American lives. Your family member will not have died in vain. [Applause] Last week, we opened an office to support the victims of immigration crime, called Voice to make sure that no American victim is ever again ignored by their government -- not going to happen anymore.
And many people are now talking, as I just said, and using this tremendous early progress on the border to say we don't need the kind of safety that we really do need, including the wall. We need safety. We need cameras. We need all of the things that we are going to be putting in, and we need the wall. And we will build the wall as sure as you are standing there tonight. We need the wall. [Applause] ...
Build that wall, build that wall, build that wall.
We will build a wall folks don't even worry about it. Go to sleep. Go home, go to sleep, rest assured. That's the final thing we needed. We need it. If the Democrat knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve it so easy because we want to stop crime in our country. Obviously, they don't mind illegals coming in. They don't mind drug pouring in. They don't mind MS-13 coming in. We are getting them all out of here. Members of congress who will be voting on border security have a simple choice. They can either vote to help drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like frankly, the Democrats are doing, or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe. That is the choice. Who do you want to represent you? [Applause] Unfortunately, Democrats in congress have no leadership. They are rudderless. Senator Schumer is a bad leader. [Booing] I have known him a long time. He is a bad leader, not a natural leader at all. He worked hard to study leadership. When you have to study leadership, you've got problems. And his policies are hurting innocent Americans and making it easier for drug dealers to enter our country. Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. [Booing] He is a poor leader -- I've known him a long time -- and he is leading the Democrats to doom. It is sad to see for our country what is happening to the Democratic party. At the heart of my administration's efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs, and that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal. [Applause] The last very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities, where they reached have it on our citizens -- where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. The bloodthirsty cartel known as MS-13 has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We have seen the horrible assaults and many killings all along Long Island where I grew up.
We are seeing the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 states and the human suffering they bring with them. I have been with the parents. It is devastation. A very respected general recently told me that MS-13 are the equivalent in their meanness to Al-Qaeda. [Booing] My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we are doing it rapidly, and we are sending them the hell out of our country.
We are sending them back home where they belong. [Applause] One by one, we are finding the illegal immigrant drug dealers come again members and killers and removing them from our country. Once they are gone, you see what we are doing. They will not let them back in. They are not coming back. [Applause]
In this effort to restore safety to our country, we are going to strongly support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] I just signed an executive order directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to combat crimes of violence against our police and the Department of Justice is now prioritizing the prosecution of criminals who attack officers of the law.
And we are also working around the clock to keep our nation safe from terrorism. My administration has taken historic steps to improve screening and vetting for those seeking visas to enter the United States. We have seen the attack from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. We have seen the bloodshed overseas. You look at what is happening in other countries. We already have enough problems to worry about in the United States, which we love so much.
We don't need to be admitting people who want to oppress press, hurt or kill innocent Americans. They are not come again. -- coming in. So let me state this as clearly as I possibly can. We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [Applause, Chanting] So I have a question for you. You have been to a lot of rallies, you have seen a lot of rallies. Is there any place like a Trump rally? [Applause]
So I did this a little bit during the rally. Haven't done it in a long time. Who has heard the poem called the snake? Does anybody wants to hear it again? Are you sure? [Applause] Ok. So let's dedicate this to General Kelly, the border patrol, and the ICE ages for doing such an incredible job. [Applause] This was written by Al Wilson, a long time ago. I thought of it having to do with our borders. We know they're going to have. We're going to have problems. We have to be smart, we have to be vigilant. So, here it is, the snake. It is called ""The Snake.""
On our way to work one morning, down the path along the lake a tenderhearted woman saw a poor have frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Poor thing, she cried out, I will take you in, and I will take care of you. The border. Take me in, oh tender woman take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night, and as soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake she taken in had been revived. Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in, for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried, but if I had not brought you in by now, by heavens you would have died.
She stroked his pretty skin again, and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite! Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in, sighed the vicious snake. I have saved you, cried the woman and you bit me, heavens why? You know your bite is poisonous, and now I am going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You new damn well I was a snake before you took me in [Applause].
Does that explain it, folks? Keeping America safe also means rebuilding our defenses. Under the leadership of General Mad Dog Mattis -- and he is doing great. By the way, he is the man who recommended General Kelly. I said mad dog, you have to give me a good general for the border. We have begun the process of rebuilding our military and restoring full readiness. We are also protecting taxpayer dollars. I have already saved more than $725 million on a simple order of F-35 planes.
I got involved in the negotiation. And there is billions of dollars to be saved. On that and many other things. We have also stepped up the fight against ISIS and we will not stop until ISIS has been destroyed. [Applause] At the same time, we have strength and our friendships and alliances all around the world. We were very proud to quietly work with the Egyptian government last week to ensure that an American citizen, a beautiful young woman named ?Aya?? came home after being in an Egyptian prison, for the past three years. [Applause]
She was going to be there for another 28 years. President Obama worked diligently for three years, did not get 'em out. I met with President el-Sisi and it worked out quickly. And he was great. And he was great about it. And not only did the court system in Egypt and president el-Sisi let her out, but they let out her husband and they let out a total of eight people that were innocent, and they are all back here right now. [Applause] Now they won't include that in the 100 days, but I am proud to have done it.
She is a happy young woman, believe me. I said how tough was it in that prison? She said you don't want to know. We are also getting NATO countries to finally step up and contribute their fair share. They have begun to increase the contribution by billions of dollars. We are not going to be satisfied until everyone pays what they owe. I have been complaining about that for a long time. And it's a lot different now, but they still a lot of money
America's average military and defense spending was double what all other NATO countries spent combined. Not fair. As we work to get other countries to pay their fair share abroad, we will continue our rebuilding at home. We are rebuilding everything, including our great military. We will have the finest military that we have ever had at any time in the history of our country. [Applause] Last week, my economics team outlined one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. Even bigger than that of Ronald Reagan. We are proposing major tax relief for the middle class and lowering the business tax from 35% all the way down to 15%. [Applause]
You will see companies expand, companies come back into our country. Companies not leave our country anymore because taxes and regulations are so onerous. You will see what happens. Let me also be clear in saying that we are going to save Americans health care and repeal and replace that disaster known as Obamacare, which is dying, dying, dying. [Applause] Obamacare is dead anyway. You know they always like to compare -- Obamacare is dead. It is gone.
The increases were massive last year and they will be bigger this year. Insurance companies are fleeing. One of the top insurers says Obamacare is in a death spiral, there is nothing they can do. They can't compare something to it because it won't be there very long. It is not working. Under Obamacare, we have seen double and triple digit hikes in premiums. Many Americans left with only a single insurer to choose from. Now many of those insurers are fleeing also. You have many like the great state of Tennessee where half of the state already has no insurance carrier. And many others. Obamacare is a catastrophe created exclusively by the Democrats in Congress. And they know it is no good.
And, by the way, we're going to get something great. We're going to get premiums down, deductibles way down. We are going to take care of every single need you are going to to have taken care of. It will not cost that kind of money. We will bring it down. You're going to see it. Premiums down. We will repeal and replace Obamacare. You watch. [Applause] We are going to give Americans the freedom to purchase the health care plans they want, not the health care forced on them by the government. And I will be so angry at Congressman Kelly and Congressman Marino and all of our Congressmen in this room if we don't get this damn thing passed quickly. [Applause]
They will get it done. We know them, they will get it done. In all things, we are returning power to the people where it belongs. We are going to defend the second amendment. [Applause] And your rights to keep and bear arms. We're going to bring education local, and we're going to end common core. [Applause] We are going to stop federal overreach and defend the God-given rights of every American family.
Just imagine what we can accomplish if we all started working together to rebuild this nation, the nation that we so dearly love. Our jobs will come back home, are dying factories will come roaring back to life. It will be a beautiful thing to watch. This is what is going to happen in the United States of America. And it is going to happen soon. And it is actually already happening. Cities small and large will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
America's children will be taught to love the country and take pride in our great American flag. [Applause] And other countries, you seee that happening, will finally treat America and our citizens with the respect that our country and our citizens deserve. The time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny. And that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. [Applause]
And we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country. We are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause] As long as we remember these truths, we will not fail. We are American, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, I say these words to you tonight on 100 days of devotion, hard work and love for our great country.
Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America prosper again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And he will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you."
2017-04-28,Speech: Donald Trump At the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum,"Atlanta, GA, United States","[-84.3879824, 33.7489954]",donald-trump-speech-national-rifle-association-april-28-2017,"Thank you, Chris, for that kind introduction and for your tremendous work on behalf of our Second Amendment. Thank you very much. [Applause] I want to also thank Wayne LaPierre for his unflinching leadership in the fight for freedom. Wayne, thank you very much. Great. [Applause]
I'd also like to congratulate Karen Handel on her incredible fight in Georgia 6. [Applause] The election takes place on June 20th. And, by the way, on primaries, let's not have 11 Republicans running for the same position, okay? [Laughter] It's too nerve-shattering. She's totally for the NRA and she's totally for the Second Amendment. So get out and vote. She's running against someone who's going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your healthcare, and he's for open borders -- lots of crime, and he's not even able to vote in the district that he's running in. Other than that, I think he's doing a fantastic job, right? [Laughter] So get out and vote for Karen.
Also, my friend -- he's become a friend, because there's nobody that does it like Lee Greenwood. Wow. [Applause] Lee's anthem is the perfect description of the renewed spirit sweeping across our country. And it really is, indeed, sweeping across our country. So, Lee, I know I speak for everyone in this arena when I say, we are all very proud indeed to be an American. Thank you very much, Lee. [Applause]
No one was more proud to be American than the beloved patriot -- and you know who I'm talking about -- we remember on gatherings like today, your former five-term President, the late Charlton Heston. How good was Charlton? [Applause] And I remember Charlton, he was out there fighting when maybe a lot of people didn't want to be fighting. He was out there for a long time. He was a great guy.
And it's truly wonderful to be back in Atlanta, and back with my friends at the NRA. You are my friends, believe me. [Applause] Perhaps some of you remember the last time we were all together. Remember that? We had a big crowd then, too. So we knew something was happening. But it was in the middle of a historic political year, and in the middle of a truly historic election. What fun that was -- November 8. Wasn't that a great evening? Do you remember that evening? [Applause] Remember that? [Applause]
Remember they were saying, ""We have breaking news: Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan."" They go, ""Michigan? How did that"" -- ""Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin, whoa."" But earlier in the evening, remember, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, all the way up -- we ran up the East Coast. And, you know, the Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College, you know that. Tremendous disadvantage. And to run the whole East Coast, and then you go with Iowa and Ohio, and all of the different states. It was a great evening, one that a lot people will never forget -- a lot of people. [Applause] Not going to forget that evening.
And remember they said, ""There is no path to 270."" For months I was hearing that. You know, they're trying to suppress the vote. So they keep saying it, so people say, you know, I really like Trump, he loves the Second Amendment, he loves the NRA; I love him, but let's go to the movie because he can't win. Because they're trying to suppress the vote.
But they'd say -- I mean, hundreds of times I heard, there is no -- there's no route. They'd say it, ""There is no route to 270."" And we ended up with 306. So they were right: Not 270, 306. [Applause] That was some evening. Big sports fans said that was the single-most exciting event they've ever seen. That includes Super Bowls and World Series and boxing matches. That was an exciting evening for all of us, and it meant a lot.
Only one candidate in the General Election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the President of the United States, standing before you again. [Applause] I have a feeling that in the next election you're going to be swamped with candidates, but you're not going to be wasting your time. You'll have plenty of those Democrats coming over and you're going to say, no, sir, no thank you -- no, ma'am. Perhaps ma'am. It may be Pocahontas, remember that. [Applause, Laughter] And she is not big for the NRA, that I can tell you.
But you came through for me, and I am going to come through for you. [Applause] I was proud to receive the NRA's earliest endorsement in the history of the organization. And today, I am also proud to be the first sitting President to address the NRA Leadership Forum since our wonderful Ronald Reagan in 1983. [Applause] And I want to thank each and every one of you not only for your help electing true friends of the Second Amendment, but for everything you do to defend our flag and our freedom.
With your activism, you helped to safeguard the freedoms of our soldiers who have bled and died for us on the battlefields. And I know we have many veterans in the audience today, and we want to give them a big, big beautiful round of applause. [Applause]
And, like I promised, we are doing a really top job already -- 99 days -- but already with the Veterans Administration, people are seeing a big difference. We are working really hard at the VA, and you're going to see it, and you're already seeing it. And it's my honor. I've been telling you we're going to do it, and we're doing it. [Applause] Thank you.
The NRA protects in our capitols and legislative houses the freedoms that our servicemembers have won for us on those incredible battlefields. And it's been a tough fight against those who would go so far as to ban private gun ownership entirely. But I am here to deliver you good news. And I can tell you that Wayne and Chris have been fighting with me long and hard to make sure that we were with you today, not somebody else with an empty podium. Because believe me, the podium would have been empty. They fought long and hard, and I think you folks cannot thank them enough. They were with us all the way, right from the beginning. [Applause]
But we have news that you've been waiting for for a long time: The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. [Applause] You have a true friend and champion in the White House. No longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. [Applause] No longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as Americans. Instead, we will work with you, by your side. We will work with the NRA to promote responsible gun ownership, to protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful outdoors. You met my son -- I can tell you, both sons, they love the outdoors. Frankly, I think they love the outdoors more than they love, by a long shot, Fifth Avenue. But that's okay. And we want to ensure you of the sacred right of self-defense for all of our citizens. [Applause]
When I spoke to this forum last year, our nation was still mourning the loss of a giant, a great defender of the Constitution: Justice Antonin Scalia. [Applause] I promised that if elected, I would nominate a justice who would be faithful and loyal to the Constitution. I even went one step further and publicly presented a list of 20 judges from which I would make my selection, and that's exactly what we did.
And, by the way, I want to thank, really, Heritage. And I want to thank also all of the people that worked with us. Where's Leo? Is Leo around here? Where is he? He's got to be here. Where is he? He has been so good. And also from Heritage, Jim DeMint. It's been amazing. I mean, those people have been fantastic. They've been real friends. [Applause] The Federalist people -- where are they? Are they around here someplace? They really helped us out.
I kept my promise, and now, with your help, our brand-new Justice -- and he is really something very special -- Neil Gorsuch, sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court. [Applause] For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. [Applause] The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. Now, we won't get any credit for this, but don't worry about it, the credit is in the audience, right? The credit is in the audience. [Applause] All of those people. They won't give us credit, but it's been a long time, and we're very honored.
We've also taken action to stand up for America's sportsmen. On their very last full day in office, the previous administration issued an 11th-hour rule to restrict the use of lead ammunition on certain federal lands. Have you heard about that, folks? I'm shocked to hear that. You've all heard about that. You've heard about that. On his first day as Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke eliminated the previous administration's ammunition ban. [Applause] He's going to be great. Ryan is going to be great.
We've also moved very quickly to restore something gun owners care about very, very much. It's called the rule of law. [Applause] We have made clear that our administration will always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] In fact, countless members of law enforcement are also members of the NRA, because our police know that responsible gun ownership saves lives, and that the right of self-defense is essential to public safety. Do we all agree with that? [Applause]
Our police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed. [Applause] For too long, Washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals, drug dealers, traffickers and gang members. MS-13 -- you know about MS-13? It's not pleasant for them anymore, folks. It's not pleasant for them anymore. That's a bad group. [Applause] Not pleasant for MS-13. Get them the hell out of here, right? Get them out. [Applause]
We are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding Americans, and we are going after the criminal gangs and cartels that prey on our innocent citizens. And we are really going after them. [Applause] As members of the NRA know well, some of the most important decisions a President can make are appointments -- and I've appointed people who believe in law, order, and justice. [Applause]
That is why I have selected as your Attorney General, number one, a really fine person, a really good man, a man who has spent his career fighting crime, supporting the police, and defending the Second Amendment. For the first time in a long time, you now have a pro-Second-Amendment, tough-on-crime Attorney General, and his name is Jeff Sessions. [Applause]
And Attorney General Sessions is putting our priorities into action. He's going after the drug dealers who are peddling their poison all over our streets and destroying our youth. He's going after the gang members who threaten our children. And he's fully enforcing our immigration laws in all 50 states. And you know what? It's about time. [Applause] Heading up the effort to secure America's borders is a great military general, a man of action: Homeland Security Director John Kelly. [Applause]
Secretary Kelly, who used to be General Kelly, is following through on my pledge to protect the borders, remove criminal aliens, and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. We've already seen -- listen to this; it never happened before, people can't even believe it. And, by the way, we will build the wall no matter how low this number gets or how this goes. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. [Applause]
You know, they're trying to use this number against us because we've done so unbelievably at the borders already. They're trying to use it against us. But you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people. You need the wall. But listen to this: We've already seen a 73 percent decrease -- never happened before -- in illegal immigration on the southern border since my election -- 73 percent. [Applause] You see what they're doing, right? So why do you need a wall? We need a wall. [Audience Member shouts ""Build the Wall""]
We'll build the wall. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it. That's an easy one. We're going to build the wall. We need the wall.
I said to General Kelly, how important is it? He said, very important. It's that final element. We need the wall. And it's a wall in certain areas. Obviously, where you have these massive physical structures you don't need, and we have certain big rivers and all. But we need a wall, and we're going to get that wall. [Applause]
And the world is getting the message. They know that our border is no longer open to illegal immigration, and that if you try to break in, you'll be caught and you'll be returned to your home. You're not staying any longer. And if you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted, and you will put behind bars. Otherwise it will never end. [Applause]
Let's also remember that immigration security is national security. We've seen the attacks from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino. Hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the United States.
We spend billions and billions of dollars on security all over the world, but then we allow radical Islamic terrorists to enter right through our front door. That's not going to happen anymore. [Applause] It's time to get tough. It's time we finally got smart. And yes, it's also time to put America first. [Applause] And perhaps -- I see all of those beautiful red and white hats --- but we will never forget our favorite slogan of them all: Make America Great Again. All right? [Applause]
Keeping our communities safe and protecting our freedoms also requires the cooperation of our state leaders. We have some incredible pro-Second Amendment governors here at the NRA conference, including Governor Scott of Florida. Where is Governor Scott? Great guy doing a great job. Governor Bryant of Mississippi. What a wonderful place. Governor Bryant is here. Thank you. Governor Deal of Georgia. [Applause] And we're also joined by two people that -- well, one I loved right from the beginning; the other one I really liked, didn't like, and now like a lot again. [Laughter] Does that make sense? Senator David Perdue -- he was from the beginning -- and Senator Ted Cruz -- like, dislike, like. [Applause] Where are they? Good guys. Good guys. Smart cookies.
Each of these leaders knows that public officials must serve under the Constitution, not above it. We all took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States -- and that means defending the Second Amendment. [Applause] So let me make a simple promise to every one of the freedom-loving Americans in the audience today: As your President, I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Never ever. [Applause] Freedom is not a gift from government. Freedom is a gift from God. [Applause]
It was this conviction that stirred the heart of a great American patriot on that day, April, 242 years ago. It was the day that Paul Revere spread his Lexington alarm -- the famous warning that ""the British are coming, the British are coming."" Right? You've all heard that, right? The British are coming.
Now we have other people trying to come, but believe me, they're not going to be successful. That I can tell you. [Applause] Nothing changes, right, folks? Nothing changes. They are not going to be successful. There will be serious hurt on them, not on us.
Next, came the shot heard around the world, and then a rag-tag army of God-fearing farmers, frontiersmen, shopkeepers, merchants that stood up to the most powerful army at that time on Earth. The most powerful army on Earth. But we sometimes forget what inspired those everyday farmers and workers in that great war for independence.
Many years after the war, a young man asked Captain Levi Preston, aged 91, why he'd fought alongside his neighbors at Concord. Was it the Stamp Act? Was it the Tea Tax? Was it a work of philosophy? ""No,"" the old veteran replied. ""Then why?"" he was asked. ""Young man,"" the Captain said, ""what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this: We always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to"" govern ourselves. [Applause]
Captain Preston's words are a reminder of what this organization and my administration are all about: the right of a sovereign people to govern their own affairs, and govern them properly. [Applause] We don't want any longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in Washington, or in any other country for that matter. In America, we are ruled by our citizens. We are ruled by each and every one of you.
But we can't be complacent. These are dangerous times. These are horrible times for certain obvious reasons. But we're going to make them great times again. Every day, we are up against those who would take away our freedoms, restrict our liberties, and even those who want to abolish the Second Amendment. We must be vigilant. And I know you are all up to the task.
Since the first generation of Americans stood strong at Concord, each generation to follow has answered the call to defend freedom in their time. That is why we are here today: To defend freedom for our children. To defend the liberty of all Americans. And to defend the right of a free and sovereign people to keep and bear arms.
I greatly appreciated your support on November 8th, in what will hopefully be one of the most important and positive elections for the United States of all time. And to the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down. Thank you. God Bless you. God Bless our Constitution, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-04-28,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-april-28-2017,"My fellow Americans. I truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country's history. Most importantly, we're bringing back jobs. You ask the people of Michigan, you ask the people of Ohio, you can ask the people of Pennsylvania, see what's happening. See the car companies come roaring back in. They don't want to leave. They want to stay here. They want a piece of the action.
Our country is going up and it's going up fast. Our companies are doing better. They just announced fantastic profits. All because of what's happened in this rather short period of time, and that's just the beginning. We're putting in a massive tax cut for the middle class and for business. It's going to have an enormous effect. The massive Keystone pipeline, the Dakota pipeline, tens of thousands of jobs right there. And so many other businesses. We're really proud of what we're doing.
The F-35 fighter jet program. It was way over budget. I've saved $725 million plus just by getting involved in the negotiation. We're cutting costs, and we're going to have a truly competitive and great country again. In just 14 weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington. The most fundamental change can be found in the relationship between the people and their government.
For too long politicians cared more about special interests and they did about a very successful future for all Americans. They took our taxpayers money and sent their jobs and wealth to other countries. not anymore. From the first day of my administration, I have governed by a simple idea: my only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens. Together, we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American people first.
That's why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That day was a turning point for a nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over. In the following weeks I took unprecedented actions to reverse federal overreach and unleash job creation. We have slashed burdensome regulations and imposed a policy that for each new regulation two regulations must be erased from the books.
We've done it all while moving quickly to restore the most basic protection for all citizens: the rule of law. A truly great judge, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the United States Supreme Court. Justice Gorsuch is deeply devoted to our Constitution. My administration is the first in modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court justice in the first 100 days. The last time it happened was 136 years ago, in 1881.
Defending the rule of law as a priority, not just in the courts but also on the streets and on the border. We've told the incredible police of our nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates. We've taken bold action to go after criminal cartels, and made it a top priority to prosecute anyone who targets law enforcement. This has been the work of my administration, fighting for the American worker, defending the rule of law, and returning the power to the American people.
Since my inauguration, economic confidence has soared, reaching higher than any time in nine years. Optimism among manufacturers is at a record high, and small business confidence has seen its largest increase in nearly four decades. Perhaps the greatest change of all is the renewal of the American spirit. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then the sun will always shine on our very glorious Republic. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-04-25,Speech: Donald Trump at U.S. Capitol for National Days of Remembrance,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-days-of-remembrance-holocaust-april-25-2017,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Friends, members of Congress, ambassadors, veterans, and, most especially, to the survivors here with us today, it's an honor to join you on this very, very solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history's darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering. Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.
We are privileged to be joined by Israel's Ambassador to the United States, friend of mine -- he's done a great job and said some wonderful words -- Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish people. The fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed is now filled with the breath of life, and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.
To those in the audience who have served America in uniform, our country eternally thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world -- for the entire world. [Applause]
Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel, a great person, a great man. His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room. It is the kind of gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness. Though Elie's story is well known by so many people, it's always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished in Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death, and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long, dark night so as never to again repeat it.
The survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget, and engrave into the world's memory the Nazi genocide of the Jewish people. You witnessed evil, and what you saw is beyond description, beyond any description. Many of you lost your entire family, everything and everyone you loved, gone. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people -- and great people, I must add. You survived the ghettos, the concentration camps and the death camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in Elie's famous plea, that ""For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.""
That is why we are here today -- to remember and to bear witness. To make sure that humanity never, ever forgets. The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy, without even a sign of mercy.
Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past. Worse still, there are even those filled with such hate, total hate, that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil. And we'll never be silent -- we just won't -- we will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again. [Applause]
Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous anti-Semitism that continues all around the world. We've seen anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it's been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish communities, or when aggressors threaten Israel with total and complete destruction.
This is my pledge to you: We will confront anti-Semitism [Applause] We will stamp out prejudice. We will condemn hatred. We will bear witness. And we will act. As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people -- and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.
So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this Earth.
We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and so brutally killed. We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine. We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.
But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness. We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved -- survivors like Steven Springfield, who, in the long death march, carried his brother on his back. As he said, ""I just couldn't give in.""
We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors -- even at the risk of their own life. And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe, waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: ""You are free.""
It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity, this call to courage in the face of evil that the survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world. We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.
I want to close with a story enshrined in the Museum that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.
It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda's family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps, and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. She assumed it was over. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day. It was tough.
Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before, but this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful, gleaming white star. Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: ""We are Jewish, you know."" ""We are Jewish."" And then he said, ""So am I."" It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness, after so much evil.
As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect -- he opened the door for her. In Gerda's words, ""that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humanness, of dignity, and of freedom.""
But the story does not end there. Because, as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her and who showed her such decency would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married. In her words, ""He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and to my future.""
Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those survivors who are among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time. Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity. But evil can only thrive in darkness. And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope -- hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
Each survivor here today is a beacon of light, and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space. Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies and one hero to change the course of history. We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil, and that as long as we refuse to close our eyes or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail. So today we mourn. We remember. We pray. And we pledge: Never again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-04-21,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-april-21-2017,"My Fellow Americans, A new optimism is sweeping our country as we return power from Washington and give it back to the American People, where it belongs. For too long, American workers were forgotten by their government and I mean totally forgotten. Their interests were pushed aside for global projects, and their wealth was taken from their communities and shipped across the world, all across the seas.
My Administration has offered a new vision. The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none and boy do I mean second to none. Since Day One I have been fighting for the hardworking people of this country and this week we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise.
We did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our nation Kenosha, Wisconsin with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world. They were there, and they loved what they heard, and they loved what they saw.
In Wisconsin, I signed an Executive Order to Buy American and Hire American. I took historic action to ensure that Federal Projects are made with American Goods and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries that break the rules and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States. Thats not going to happen anymore.
I also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first the duty of government is to represent the citizens of the United States, and that is what we will do. Whether its removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy, we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American Worker.
During my visit, I talked about how America is a nation that honors work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the skilled tradespeople who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty. Theres tremendous talent there, believe me.
The wrench and ratchet are not only tools, but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across oceans. And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO, or even the tools of politicians, believe it or not and their work is every bit as noble. They take pride in their jobs, and we take pride in them.
No longer will the concerns of these hardworking Americans go unanswered. By making government answer to our citizens, we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people. As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar. Hope will continue to spring. And this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day. Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America."
2017-04-18,"Speech - Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Signing Buy American Executive Order ","Kenosha, WI, United States","[-87.82118539999999, 42.5847425]",donald-trump-speech-buy-american-kenosha-wi-april-18-2017,"Thank you very much. [Applause] These are great, great people and these are real workers. I love the workers. We're doing a good job for the workers. And I'm thrilled to be back in Wisconsin. The optimism in this room is the same incredible spirit that is sweeping across our country -- and even greater than that great day in November when I won the state of Wisconsin and when we won the presidency. That was a great day. [Applause] That was a great day. And thank you, Wisconsin.
No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days -- that includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement -- we love our law enforcement -- and on government reform.
Today, we're building on that optimism, and I'm proud to announce that we're about to take bold, new steps to follow through on my pledge to Buy American and Hire American. [Applause]
I can't think of a better place to make this announcement than right here at Snap-On -- I just took a tour of the company -- good place, by the way; it's doing well, too -- standing among the workers who make the tools that will rebuild our nation. Your craftsmanship is incredible.
It's a pleasure to be see my good friend, Governor Scott Walker. He has been such a big help. He has been so incredible. [Applause] Stand up, Scott. Governor Walker. As well as Senator Ron Johnson. We worked hard together. Thank you, Ron. [Applause]
And although he could not be here today, my thanks go to Speaker Ryan, who's represented this city for nearly two decades in Congress. And you know where he is? He's with NATO -- so he has a good excuse. And I said, Ron, make sure these countries start paying their bills a little bit more. They're way, way behind, Ron. We have to -- or I'm going to talk to you about that, Ron.
But Paul, you're over with NATO -- get them to pay their bills. And, Ron, you have to work on that, too. And, Scott, you're right here in Wisconsin -- you don't have to bother. We'll keep you right here. [Laughter] For a little while at least.
Also with us is a famous local resident, the pride of Kenosha -- Reince Priebus, my Chief of Staff. Where is Reince? [Applause] Where is he? What a good man. There he is. In fact, we flew over his house on the way up and he got all excited, he was taking pictures of it. [Laughter] Reince went to high school right here, just about a mile away, where he took his wife Sally to the prom. And that was a match made in heaven. Very nice.
I also want to thank Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for being with us today. Secretary Mnuchin is working to put together a tax reform plan to make our industry more competitive and also to provide a level playing field for our workers. We don't have a level playing field, believe me. You're going to have one very soon. And our tax reform and tax plan is coming along very well. It's going to be out very soon. We're working on healthcare and we're going to get that done, too.
Our Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also here. Where is Betsy? She's around here someplace. Stand up. Thank you, Betsy. [Applause] Secretary DeVos is working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will, in the future, power our country.
I'm excited to be joined today by students from Gateway Technical College -- [Applause] -- and remember the college president, Bryan Albrecht. Thank you. [Applause] Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Bryan. Your partnership with Snap-On is a great example of why vocational education is the way of the future.
When I was growing up in Queens, we had vocational schools that were great. We don't have schools like that so much anymore, but we're bringing them back -- vocational schools. These are very talented people that love that type of work, and it's great work. It really is great work. So vocational schools are going to be a big factor in the Trump administration.
Together, we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that more products are stamped with those wonderful words: ""Made in the USA."" [Applause] In the old days, we used to use it. We don't use it so much anymore. We're going to start using it again -- Made in the USA.
For too long, we've watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands. We've lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. And you've seen that and you've heard about it -- 70,000. The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters. But this election, the American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity. They voted to bring back their jobs -- and to bring back their dreams into our country.
That's why I'm here today. In just a few moments, I will be signing a Buy American and Hire American executive order. You haven't heard about that in a long time in this country. With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world: We're going to defend our workers, protect our jobs, and finally put America first. [Applause] I see all the ""Make America Great Again"" hats, so it's a good crowd. Those are good hats.
Through the years, Snap-On tools have been at the center of our industrial life. Your tools have fixed the cars our families depend on. They've sailed with the fleets that patrol the oceans. They've fixed the planes that cross our skies. And Snap-On tools have reached the heights of space, used by astronauts in orbit to carry out their very, very important work. And I don't know if you noticed, recently I signed a very big order: We're going to spend again on the NASA space program, and that's something we need, and we also need it psychologically. [Applause] But it's going to be very exciting.
For decades, this company has served the needs of American workers. It's time we had a federal government that does the same. The ""Buy and Hire American"" order I'm about to sign will help protect workers and students like those of you in the audience today. This historic action declares that the policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job. It's America first, you better believe it. [Applause] It's time. It's time, right? It's time.
First, we will fully monitor, uphold and enforce our Buy American laws -- which we haven't done. Buy American laws require that when the federal government buys, builds or funds a project, domestic goods and products should be used. But over the years, these Buy American standards have been gutted by excessive waivers and reckless exemptions. The result has been countless jobs and countless contracts that have been lost to cheap, subsidized, and low-quality foreign goods.
With this order, I am directing every single agency in our government to strictly uphold our Buy American laws, to minimize the use of waivers, and to maximize Made in America content in all federal projects. [Applause] It's time. And for the first time ever, we are going to crack down on foreign bidders that used dumped steel and other subsidized goods to take contracts from workers like you. They take them away, and they've been doing it for a long time. Not going to happy anymore. [Applause]
We are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. In short, this order declares that American projects should be made with American goods. No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of federal contracts. Everyone in my administration will be expected to enforce every last Buy American provision on behalf of the American worker, and we are going to investigate every single trade deal that undermines these provisions.
Secondly, we are going to enforce the Hire American rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the United States. We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first. Does that make sense? [Applause] Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay. This will stop. American workers have long called for reforms to end these visa abuses. And today, their calls are being answered for the first time. That includes taking the first steps to set in motion a long-overdue reform of H1B visas.
Right now, H1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery -- and that's wrong. Instead, they should be given to the most-skilled and highest-paid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans. No one can compete with American workers when they're given a fair and level playing field, which has not happened for decades.
We're using every tool at our disposal to restore the American Dream. In fact, when it comes to wasteful, destructive, job-killing regulations, we are going to use a tool you all know very well -- it's called the sledgehammer. [Laughter] It's what we're going to use. We're also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin -- [Applause] -- and I've been reading about it, and I've been talking about it for a long time -- and that demands, really, immediately fair trade with all of our trading partners, and that includes Canada. [Applause] Because in Canada, some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others, and we're going to strategy working on that with Ron and with Scott and with Paul, with all of your representatives. What's happened to you is very, very unfair. It's another typical one-sided deal against the United States. And it's not going to be happening for long.
So, Scott, you and Ron and myself and Paul and everybody else, we're going to get together and we're going to call Canada, and we're going to say, ""What happened?"" And they might give us an answer, but we're going to get the solution, not just the answer, okay? Because we know what the solution is, all right? [Applause] And if you guys can't do it, we'll bring maybe Reince. Reince, you ready, Reince? We better bring Reince back. No, we'll get that done. We're going to work on that very hard. We're going to work on it immediately; in fact, starting today. It's a terrible thing that happened to the farmers of Wisconsin.
The fact is, NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States -- a complete and total disaster. And we're going to do some things, and we have all sorts of rules and regulations that are horrendous. Like we want to start to negotiate with Mexico immediately, and we have these provisions where you have to wait long periods of time, you have to notify Congress, and after you notify Congress, you have to get certified, and then you can't speak to them for 100 days. The whole thing is ridiculous.
NAFTA has been very, very bad for our country. It's been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we're going to make some very big changes or we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all. Cannot continue like this, believe me. [Applause]
Big things will be happening on trade with other countries over the coming months, and I mean very big. We're also working with Congress on tax reform and simplification, and we're on time if we get that healthcare approval. So press every one of your congressmen, press everybody, because we want to get that approval. And it just makes the tax reform easier and it makes it better. But it's going to make it steeper, it's going to be bigger, and that's what we want to do.
So we're in very good shape on tax reform. We have the concept of the plan. We're going to be announcing it very soon. But healthcare -- we have to get the healthcare taken care of. And as soon as healthcare takes care of -- we are going to march very quickly. You're going to watch -- we're going to surprise you. Right, Steve Mnuchin? Right? Secretary of Treasury. [Applause] I see Sean. Stand up, Sean. Stand up.
I had no idea -- I was told a year ago -- he's been so great to me -- I was told a year ago he's like a world champion climber; climbs the trees. And after that I look -- every time I look at him, I look at him now differently. I'm very impressed with that, Sean. And he's also very good on television and very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you.
We'll be making big investments in rebuilding our military and repairing our badly depleted infrastructure. And that will happen soon also -- infrastructure. Big infrastructure bill, probably use it with something else that's a little bit harder to get approved in order to get that approved. But infrastructure is coming, and it's coming fast.
New ships, bridges, tunnels and airplanes will be constructed with American hands, American steel, and, yes, American tools. [Applause] As we work to restore the American Dream at home, we're also working to restore America's standing abroad. That means strengthening our partnerships and ensuring that our friends and allies pay their fair share, and that very much includes, as I've already said in my little statement to Paul, it also includes the NATO companies and countries. They are really sort of letting us down in that one respect, and we don't want people taking advantage of the United States. And that's not going to happen for very much longer. I'm going over there very soon and we're going to have it, and everybody is going to be paying. And we're going to be a much happier country, we're going to be a much happier world.
No matter the circumstances, everyone will know we act from this core conviction that America's strength must be unmatched and its first priority unquestioned -- the safety and security of our citizens. This is the surest path to a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all.
Together, we can build a better future in the spirit of this company's earliest days. Great company, great history. I recently learned that decades ago, in the 1920s, when your salesman entered a dusty repair shop, or stained, a nice, beautiful stained garage floor -- which I've seen many of -- they would find a spot to lay out a beautiful green felt mat. The people of the company know what that means. And on that green felt mat, he would carefully place a gleaming set of new Snap-On tools.
The founders of this company wanted their customers to know that the tools of the mechanic were just as important as the tools of the doctor, the dentist, the politician, or the business leader, and that his craft was a noble, noble craft, as noble as any. This is a wonderful story about your company and its Wisconsin heritage. And Wisconsin has a truly great heritage, and it's led by incredible people.
But it's also a story that tells us a lot about the American spirit. In America, we honor work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two hands. In America, we honor all of you.
We are a nation of builders. We are the country that dug out the Panama Canal, that put a man on the face of the moon, and that linked our cities with majestic railroads and curving highways. We are the country that is always on the cusp of the next invention. But we can only get there with all of you. We can only restore this nation we love so much by working and building with all of you.
We can only get there together. We are the one people sharing one destiny, saluting one great, beautiful American flag. I'm thrilled to be here today to celebrate our great American heritage and to proudly embrace our great American future.
I want to thank the people of Wisconsin for doing so much for me. That's why I came back here -- not just for the company, frankly, for the people of Wisconsin. You have been so incredible to me and my administration, and we will never, ever let you down.
God bless you. God bless the American worker. God bless the American Dream. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much. Tremendous honor. Thank you very much. [Applause]
So get ready everybody. This is a big one. Get ready. How about having someâ¦ Scott, Rob, everybody, come on up. Come on up. The lieutenant governor. Come on up. Come on up here. Who should I give the pen to is the big question? I think one of them should get it. Come on up. Great representatives. Come on up. Okay, this is a tremendous honor for me. The only question is: who gets the pen. [Signs order. Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much."

This week, Jewish families across our country, and around the world, celebrate Passover and retell the story of God's deliverance of the Jewish people. The story of the Exodus is a story of freedom. It is the story of an incredible people who were liberated from oppression and raised up the face of humankind.
Down through the centuries, the Jewish People have lived through one persecution after anotherâand yet, they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure. And now, the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance. Another day of faith and celebration is also upon us.
This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation. It is a holy day of reverence and worship; it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people. America is a Nation of believers.
As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home. We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future.
From the beginning, America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship. That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continentâand it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago.
Sadly, many around the globe do not enjoy this freedomâand one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror. On Palm Sunday, as Christians around the world celebrate the beginning of Holy Week, ISIS murdered at least 45 people and injured over 100 others at two Christian churches in Egypt.
We condemn this barbaric attack. We mourn for those who lost loved ones. And we pray for the strength and wisdom to achieve a better tomorrowâone where good people of all faiths, Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu, can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience.
With God's grace, life always triumphs over death, freedom overcomes oppression, and faith extinguishes fear. This is the source of our hopeâand our confidence in the future.
I also want to give a special message to those struggling Americans who have felt for too long the bitter taste of hardship. I want you to know: this White House is fighting for you. We are fighting for every American who has been left behind. We are fighting for the right of all citizens to enjoy safety and peaceâand to work and live with the dignity that all Children of God are entitled to know.
As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, we will succeed. Thank you. Have a Happy Easter, and a Happy Passover. God bless you. And God bless America."

We're only 11 weeks in, but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people. In fact, 93 percent of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record.
The confidence we're seeing in our nation is about jobs and opportunity. But it's also about safety and security. Security begins at the border. As a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I've done.
We inherited a full-fledged border crisis  -- it was a disaster. Yet with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time.
Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border. At the same time, we're conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society, and they'll be gone.
In just the last few days our nation's ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in South Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York.
These arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing and many more.
Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington. But with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done and save countless lives in the process.
Providing security for the American people also means restoring America's standing in the world. From the very start of my presidency I've worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe.
This week I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China, at the southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples.
In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me and so important to our people -- one of the reasons certainly that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens.
In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world. That is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people.
Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals, and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences.
A future of peace, safety and prosperity -- that is our guiding light, and always will be. Together we will bring about this future for the land we love and for the people who call it home. We love our country, and we love the American people. Thank you."

I know them too well. [Applause] I know them too well. They cost me a lot of money. [Laughter] I spent a lot of money, but I love them, and they're great, and their people are fantastic. And nobody does it like you people, right? Nobody. We talked about that -- incredible. Incredible people.
So it's great to be back with America's builders. [Applause] So did you ever think you'd see a President who knows how much concrete and rebar you can lay down in a single day? Believe me, I know. I know. [Applause] We're a nation of builders, and it was about time we had a builder in the White House, right? [Applause] We have a builder.
I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it's in Washington, because I don't have to travel very far. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.
Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House Ã- he mentioned it -- and I promise you that America's labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. [Applause] Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators -- (applause) -- never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? Let's hear it. Laborers. [Applause] Painters. [Applause] Fitters. [Applause] Plumbers. [Applause] Operators -- they're operators, all right, I'll tell you that. [Laughter] Electricians. [Applause] Not that good. Where's my Local 3? Where's Local 3? That wasn't that good, the electricians -- well, they became so rich they don't have to -- (laughter) -- let's do that again. Electricians. [Applause] That's better.
Bricklayers. [Applause] Boilermakers. [Applause] Elevator constructors. [Applause] Good job. Sheet-metal workers. [Applause] Roofers. [Applause] Plasterers -- plaster, well, yeah, that's -- not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? No matter how you cut it. Sorry about that. I'm not sure I can do much -- we brought back the coalminers. I'm not so sure about the plasterers. We'll do the best we can, okay? We're going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons. [Applause] And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters. [Applause] Oh, that wasn't very good, James.
But really, you're the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. [Applause] But we're going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our nation. [Applause]
You're the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge. You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed. They're on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. You know that. True. True. [Applause]
We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. [Applause] That was a terrible time -- we were all there -- that was a terrible time in this country's history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate -- that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you. [Applause]
The fact is you take pride in every part of your work -- every joist, bolt, and rivet. You're not only builders, but you're artisans, very talented people. A lot of people don't understand, you're very talented people -- enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it's time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.
Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves. Now it's your turn. And you're going to be also sharing the wealth. [Applause] And you know, for many years, we've been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn't have a clue or worse. That's not going to happen anymore, folks. That's not going to happen anymore. And you see what's going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down -- just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we're going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country. That I can tell you right now. [Applause]
This election was all about returning power to the people. I've spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. [Applause] One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker -- I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster -- this would have been a disaster -- this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause] Thank you. That one wasn't even close. And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.
Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. [Applause] And it's looking like that's going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That's a big, big, beautiful -- lot of people. And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.
And I joked that day -- I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines -- and they failed. Didn't work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door -- sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.
Can you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he's a nice guy. He actually -- they came to the office. [Applause] Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it. So you can't be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel? I didn't like the answer. I said, who fabricated the steel? I didn't like the answer. I said, from now on we're going to put a clause -- got to be made in America. We want American steel, made in America. [Applause] Right on the box. 100 percent, right? [Applause]
And you'll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let's say, over the next seven and three-quarters years -- meaning eight years -- [Laughter]
We believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. That's what it's going to be. [Applause] And that's not just a slogan, it's a promise. Believe me, that's a promise. [Applause]
The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It's come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who've made one wrong prediction after another -- delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.
For decades now, we've watched as our factories have shuttered -- almost 70,000 factories -- our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We've seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn't just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.
We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. [Applause] I'm not -- and I don't want to be -- the President of the world. I'm the President of the United States. And from now on, it's going to be America First. [Applause]
We're going to bring back our jobs -- and, yes, we're going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country -- the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don't have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you. [Applause]
I don't know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger -- the anger and hatred, and they're trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said -- because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there's no way to 270 -- you need 270 -- there's no way to 270. I heard that so much for a year -- I kept saying, maybe I shouldn't be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn't run because there's no way. The people are telling me -- the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they're saying, there's no way to 270. But there was a way to 306.
But wasn't that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered -- Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn't even need them. And we love those two states -- because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don't run it, you can't win. Huge disadvantage, Electoral College. It's very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.
We had tremendous -- we had tremendous support. Oh, we did. We had tremendous support. [Applause] We had tremendous support. And I'll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. But would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won't be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be -- it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000 -- think of this -- 750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.
Since taking office, I've signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart -- is that chart around here someplace? Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it's amazing, actually.
This is -- if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. It's a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then at the end of the period they vote against it. And we're getting rid of many of these regulations. [Applause] You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.
In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.
I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. [Applause] They're great people.
Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade. You've seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey -- which is a old survey -- 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.
The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent -- for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.
We're also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is -- just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time -- has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. [Applause] Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we'll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we're doing that right now. [Applause]
These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We've done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We've done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly. We're fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.
But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We're the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if government continues to punish America's builders, then we will not be that nation any longer.
I'm calling on all Americans -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country. [Applause]
That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. [Applause] With your help, we can rebuild our country's bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America's middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.
All of you have come to the nation's capital to call members of the House and Senate to action. You've also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America's building trades and its President are very much united. [Applause]
Together, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation's history -- an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We've all seen the pictures -- rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time -- 13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that -- the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn't even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time.
When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment -- as we still do today -- with what is called a ""topping out"" ceremony: 1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag. [Applause]
The ironworkers!
They did a good job. They did a good -- those ironworkers, you better believe it.
It was an American flag that represented American projects
-- the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people. That banner marked our nation's proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.
Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done. [Applause]
For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.
In the future, when we become -- the trials -- and we are -- trials of our times -- we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It's happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.
In this future, our nation's workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.
May God bless our nation's builders. May God bless our nation's workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-03-31,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-march-31-2017,"My fellow Americans, It's an exciting time for our country. Our new Administration has so much change underway change that is going to strengthen our Union and improve so many peoples lives.
In the next few days, the Senate will be taking a very important step one that will protect the rule of law and democratic way of life that is absolutely a birthright of all Americans.
And it involves one of my most important actions as President. That was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia. Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified. He has a sterling record. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals.
But Judge Gorsuchs nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. Its about preserving our Republic.
In their great wisdom, the Founders placed legislative power in its own separate branch of government. Elected representatives from all across the country come together. They host hearings, they listen to the concerns of the people, and then, they try to write laws that address those concerns and make life better for all Americans. Its a process that is meant to take time and energy to ensure that every new law will better serve our wonderful citizens. Thats how our democratic process works.
The duty of judges, therefore, is not to re-write the laws but to uphold the laws, and to apply the Constitution as written. That is the solemn duty of every Justice on the Supreme Court and this is what Judge Gorsuch will do.
In recent years, weve seen more and more judges make decisions not based on the Constitution or the rule of law, but based on their preferences, their personal views, or even their political opinions.
Each time a judge substitutes their own opinions for an unbiased reading of the law, they damage our democracy. They put their own will above the will of the people. And they undermine the legislative process that has always been the heartbeat of our democracy.
The Senate will soon have the chance to help preserve our democratic institutions for our children by voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
Judge Gorsuch is going to serve our people by devoting himself to our beloved Constitution. The Senate saw this firsthand in hours of Judge Gorsuchs impressive testimony. In every step of the process, what has been clear to all is that Judge Gorsuch is a man who respects the law. He defends the Constitution. And in doing so, he will protect our freedoms.
With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, America will be a more free, fair, and just Nation for all of our citizens.Thank you, and God bless you."
2017-03-25,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-march-25-2017,"My fellow Americans - this week, in the company of astronauts, I was honored to sign the NASA Transition Authorization Act right into law. With this legislation, we renew our national commitment to NASA's mission of exploration and discovery. And we continue a tradition that is as old as mankind. We look to the heavens with wonder and curiosity.
More than two decades ago, one scientist followed his curiosity and dramatically changed our understanding of the universe. The year was 1995. Taxpayers were spending billions and billions of dollars on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The astronomer in charge had a novel idea. He wanted to use the expensive telescope in a totally unconventional way.
Instead of pointing Hubble's eye at nearby stars or distant formations, Robert Williams wanted to peer into the void. He aimed the massive telescope at one of the emptiest regions of the night sky. For ten days during Christmas of 1995, Hubble stared into the abyss seeking whatever light it could glean from the darkness. And it was total darkness.
Fellow astronomers didn't know if he'd see much of anything. But Williams was rewarded and the entire world was struck by the awesome images our satellite returned. In that tiny patch of sky, the Hubble Deep Field showed thousands of lights. Each brilliant spot represented not a single star but an entire galaxy.
The discovery was absolutely incredible. But the unforgettable image did not satisfy our deep hunger for knowledge. It increased evermore and even more and reminded us how much we do not know about space; frankly, how much we do not know about life.
With this week's NASA reauthorization, we continue progress on Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope. It is amazing. The Webb Telescope is set to launch next year. It will gaze back through time and space to the very first stars and the earliest galaxies in the universe. We can only imagine what incredible visions it will bring.
At a time when Washington is consumed with the daily debates of our nation, I was proud that Congress came together overwhelmingly to reaffirm our nation's commitment to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.
NASA's greatest discoveries teach us many, many things. One lesson is the need to view old questions with fresh eyes. To have the courage to look for answers in places we have never looked before. To think in new ways because we have new information. Most of all, new discoveries remind us that, in America, anything is possible if we have the courage and wisdom to learn.
In the span of one lifetime, our nation went from black and white pictures of the first airplanes to beautiful images of the oldest galaxies, captured by a camera in outer space. I am confident that if Americans can achieve these things, there is no problem we cannot solve. There is no challenge we cannot meet. There is no aim that is too high.
Whatever it takes and however long it will be, we are a nation of problem solvers and the future belongs to us. We are truly a great place to be. I love America."
2017-03-21,Speech: Donald Trump at the NRCC Dinner,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-nrcc-dinner-march-21-2017,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Wow. You know, I asked how many people would be here tonight. They said a couple of hundred, it was just like a little fund-raiser. They didn't say you broke -- 23 years you broke the all-time record tonight, $30.1 million, and broke it by $10 million. That's not so close. So congratulations. We're going to have a great eight years together. [Applause]
And Rasmussen just came out with a very good poll. You'll be liking this poll. This poll is good. We're going to do a good job. More importantly, we're going to do a great job. And they we're going to win it the old-fashioned way. We're just going to win it. I want to thank everybody.
This is a lot more than 200 people. This is a hell of a big room. That's far back. Can you see over there? See, I would've gotten rid of these columns actually. [Laughter] That's construction man. But that was a long time ago. They didn't do that.
Well, it's an honor to address you tonight and thank each and every one of you for your role in helping to build, sustain and grow a truly strong Republican Party again. In this effort we will be working hand-in-hand with our House leadership team. I've really got to know them and they are winners and they are terrific people. Terrific people. [Applause]
Speaker Paul Ryan, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and conference chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. What a group. Great group. Also with us tonight, a man who I have a lot of respect for, gave me a very early endorsement. Former Vice President Dick Cheney. Along with his daughter Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Liz. [Applause]
I also want to thank the chairman of the Republican Congressional -- I mean, look, what a group -- committee. Where is Steve? They lost him backstage. Steve Stivers, where is he. Steve, what the hell happened? Everyone's looking. The second time he's been introduced. Steve, are you there? No.
Come here, Steve. What a job you did. Come here, Steve. He's embarrassed. Come here, come on. Get up here, Steve. Come here. [Applause] Say thanks, everybody. That's a real worker. No talk, all action, right? We like people like that. Congratulations to Steve.
And March dinner chairman, Steve Womack and the NRCC finance chair, Ann Wagner. Thank you. Thank you, Ann. [Applause] The work of the NRCC never ends. In fact, we have four special elections currently underway. In Georgia. We won. Montana. We won. Kansas. We won. And South Carolina. We love South Carolina. That's some group. Where South Carolina? Oh, we love South Carolina. Remember, I was supposed to lose that one big and we won by 21 points, and that's when I found out these polls are rigged. They were rigged. Thank you, South Carolina. I learned a lot in South Carolina.
My nominees from Montana and Kansas are here with us this evening. Greg Gianforte and Ron Estes. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause] On November 8th, the American people voted for historic change, and they also voted for serious action. By delivering the House, the Senate and the White House, the American people gave us clear instructions. It's time to get to work and to get the job done. [Applause]
That legislative effort begins with Thursday's crucial vote, and it really is a crucial vote for the Republican Party and for the people of our country, to finally repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. That's what it is, a disaster. [Applause]
Premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits. Insurance companies are fleeing. One-third of counties only have one Obamacare insurer left. I was in Tennessee four nights ago. They've lost half the state. The insurance companies are gone, and they are going to lose the next one pretty soon from what they say.
Last night in Kentucky we had a tremendous crowd, 25,000 people, more, and a similar crowd in Tennessee by the way. Packed. Thousands of people outside. They couldn't get them into these massive arenas. There's something going on that's really incredible in this country. It's really incredible. But Kentucky also is having a tremendous problem, as you know, and as you read with Obamacare, and many other states.
The House bill ends the Obamacare nightmare and gives health care decisions back to the states and back to the American people. These are the conservative solutions we campaigned on, and these are the conservative solutions the American people asked us as a group to deliver.
We are keeping our promises. I go to these arenas that have signs all over the place, he's kept his promise, he's kept his promise, because I've done a lot of work. The border is in the best shape it's been in in decades. Down 61 percent since the inauguration. [Applause]
General Kelly, you know, they used to put political people. I refuse to say political hacks because I would not say that, because there is no such thing as a political hack. But they would put nice political people at the border. I put General Kelly, recommended by 'Mad Dog' Mattis. [Applause]
I said to him, General Mattis, I said, General, I need somebody really smart and really tough for the border. Sir, I have the man. General Kelly. As soon as I saw him it was like the interview lasted for about 30 seconds. I said, he's the right guy. And he's been great. And General Mattis has been great. You see what's going on. Big difference.
It's been 60 days since my inauguration, and that was a promise that I really kept. As you saw today in the Senate, I nominated a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [Applause]
I've taken historic action to eliminate unnecessary job killing regulations, and we've just started on that one. But we've gotten rid of a lot of them. That includes eliminating regulations crushing our coal industry. We're going to put our great coal miners back to work. Clean coal, clean coal. [Applause]
I've cleared the way for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines and added a requirement that American pipelines be constructed with American steel. That was the last minute. I said, where we getting this steel? I won't tell you where, but you can guess. I said, from now on we've got to build them here. You want to put pipelines under our lands, you're going to make the pipe in this country. [Applause]
And one other thing happened. I have to tell you, it's sort of interesting. So I get a call from the ex-president of Goldman Sachs, who now works for us, Gary Cohn. I said to him, Gary, let me ask you. I heard there was a lawsuit. I hear the pipeline company is suing us. I said, how much? $14 billion.
I said, wait a minute. I'm approving the pipeline and they are suing us for $14 billion and I've already approved it, right? I said, I just heard it. Go back to them and tell them if they don't drop the suit immediately, we are going to terminate the deal. You know, being president gives you great power, right?
So I just saw him this morning. I said, by the way, how are you doing? He said, sir, they dropped the suit. Good. Isn't it easier? Look, do you think Hillary does that? I don't think so. I don't think so. Isn't that easier, though, that settling for like $4 billion seven years from now? But the lawyers aren't happy at all. They don't like it. We've got a lot of lawyers in this crowd. They're not happy about that deal.
Because of the new business climate that we are creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in. Companies like Sprint, Intel, Exxon, Mobil, where a great man, Rex Tillerson, is doing an incredible job. [Applause]
Ran the company for many years and ran it well. Walmart, Ford, Fiat, Chrysler, General Motors have all announced that they are keeping or adding tens of thousands of jobs right here in America. Big difference. You used to hear that they were all leaving. Now they are all coming back. They are coming back too, believe me, because if they don't, we are taxing the hell out of their products, so you know they're coming back. [Laughter]
Why didn't somebody start doing that 25 years ago? One company said, sir, we're building a big plant. There's nothing we can do to stop it. It's already under construction. I said, here's the story. When you make your cars, or whatever, and you fire all our American employees and then you think in your new plant, beautiful new plant, congratulations, you're going to sell that product across our border tax-free, you're wrong. Thirty-five percent tax. It's amazing how quickly they say, you know, I think we decided to stay in the United States.
I'd only wonder, why didn't somebody do this 25 years ago? We would've had nobody leaving. So far I think I'm batting about 100 percent. To save taxpayer dollars I've already begun negotiating better contracts for the federal government, saving over $700 million I just one set of airplanes, of which there are many sets. As I promised during the campaign, I have proposed a budget for the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the United States military. We need it more than ever. We need it more than ever. We've got a lot of haters out there. They hate. [Applause]
We've got some people running some countries that are bad people. We will take care of them. We will ensure that the American warrior -- and if you think about it, the great American warriors, because that's what they are -- are given the tools, the funding, the resources, the training and equipment they so richly deserve. They are warriors and they have old equipment. They're not going to have old equipment much longer.
And we will take care of our great veterans. What's happening there is going to be incredible. Finally we're going to take care of our veterans. [Applause] Our defense expansion will fully pay, and this will be something that is so important, it will be fully paid by making government leaner, more accountable and just perfect for our people. But I will tell you, if it's not fully paid -- because we are doing a big number with the planes and the ships. You know, our Navy is at World War I levels. Can you believe that? World War I levels.
So we don't fully pay, we're going to do a little work, but we're going to get our military rebuilt, bigger and better and stronger than ever because we have no choice, folks. Some bad players out there. It's going to go quickly. [Applause]
I have also followed through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the United States, and yes, we will build a great border wall at our southern border. Will be built. [Applause]
These security actions will save billions of dollars, millions of jobs and thousands and thousands of lives. We are also taking decisive action to improve our vetting procedures. The courts are not helping us, I have to be honest with you. It's ridiculous. Somebody said I should not criticize judges. OK, I'll criticize judges. To keep criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country.
We are keeping these promises and many, many more. After we repeal and replace Obamacare, our Republican majority will pass massive, historic tax reform. The biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and potentially even bigger. Going to be very big. [Applause]
And by the way, we had to go. Had no choice, had to go with the health care first. You know how it works. This is one room that really does know how it works. But we had to go with the health care first, and we are doing well. I think we're going to have some great surprises. I hope that is going to work out.
Then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they are going to be really fantastic and I am looking forward to that one. That one is going to be fun. That's called the wheelhouse. We're going to do a great job for companies, we're going to bring back could be $3 trillion to $5 trillion from overseas, money that can't be brought back. It's part of our taxes. [Applause]
And it will lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive anywhere in the world. Way, way down. [Applause] We will do everything we can to lower business burdens and to make it easier for our businesses to thrive and compete. But in exchange they must hire, invest and grow in America. We are not giving them anything, okay.
They've got to do that. That's the one thing. Working with the automobile industry, who have been played around with. And I'm saying, we'll do things for you but you've got to build new plants all over the place. You've got to build new plants in our country. And they are doing it. They are starting. It's going to be amazing.
I've called this model, the model that you been watching, the model that's created so much value, the model of bringing back jobs and bring back industry, I called that the American model. [Applause]
And this is the system that our founders wanted. Our greatest American leaders, including George Washington, Hamilton, Jackson, Lincoln, they all agreed that for America to be a strong nation, it must also be a great manufacturing nation. You have to make money. The Republican platform of 1896, more than a century ago, stated that protection and reciprocity are twin measures of American policy and go hand in hand.
I mean, we have situations where other countries who have zero respect for our country -- by the way, did you notice they are starting to respect us a lot? A lot. A lot. They will charge us 100 percent tax in some countries, 100 percent, and we charge them nothing. They will make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet they will sell their product routinely in our country. Not going to happen anymore the word reciprocity, they do it, we do it. Who can complain about that? Big difference. You're talking about big, big dollars too, by the way.
The platform went on to say, we renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection as a bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of American development and prosperity. Now these are some of our greatest leaders, some of whom were great businesspeople. They understood we have to do it.
And just so you understand, I'm a free trader, but free trade has been very unfair trade. So I now say I'm a fair trader. And I want to trade all over the world. I don't want to have it just here, but we are going to be beneficiaries from now on. We're not going to be the people that are taken advantage of any longer. That's been happening for decades and decades. Not going to happen any longer, and they know it. [Applause]
One country came in to see me recently, big country, good country, great person. One of his first questions, sir, how much will you be charging us? It's like he knew. He knew. He knew they've been ripping us for years and he finally saw somebody that understands, so one of those things.
You don't mind having a rich nation again and having lower taxes, do you? Does anybody here mind? If anybody minds, please stand up. I know Dick Cheney will not stand on this one. Please stand up. As long as the GOP stands for made in the USA -- remember the old days, cars made in the USA, right? We don't have that too much anymore. We're going to have it again soon. I'm telling all the car companies, put a big label, made in the USA. It's going to stand for quality.
Our party will have a very, very bright future. It is fitting that we are in the National Building Museum. Since its founding, the Republican Party has been a party of builders. Many of the great builders are in this audience tonight. Some of them I have to compete with, and actually I don't like very many of them, but you know. Some of them I do. [Laughter]
Some of them I truly dislike a lot. But now I like everybody. I like all the great builders. See, now it's different. Now we're all on the same side, so I like -- see the guy over there? I couldn't stand that guy for years. He did a good job but I couldn't stand him. Now I like you.
Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, ran his first campaign for public office in 1832, when he was only 23 years old. He began by measuring the benefits a railroad could bring to his port of Illinois, without ever having seen a steam powered train. He had no idea, and yet he knew what it could be.
Thirty years later, as president, Lincoln signed a law that built the first transcontinental railroad, uniting our country from ocean to ocean. Great president. Most people don't even know he was a Republican, right. Does anyone know? A lot of people don't know that. We have to build that up a little bit more. Let's take an ad, let's use one of those PACs. [Laughter]
Those PACs. You never know what the hell is going to come out of those PACs. You think they're friendly. Although the best ad I ever had was one done against me by Hillary. It was so good I said, I hope she keeps running that ad.
Another great Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, had a vision of a national infrastructure plan. As an officer in the Army after World War I, he joined a military convoy that trekked across the nation to the Pacific Coast. It traveled along the Lincoln Highway, called then the Lincoln Highway.
Its journey began by the South lawn of the White House, and a monument known today as zero milestone. Does anybody know where that is? The journey made a great impression on then-young Eisenhower. More than three decades later, as president, he signed a bill that created our great interstate highway system, once again uniting us as a nation.
Now is the time for a new Republican administration, working with our Republican Congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill. [Applause] Our party must dream is big and as full as Lincoln and Eisenhower. Together Republicans will lead America into our unbelievable future. We have so much potential. We have so much potential. I see it now even more than I saw it in this great campaign, which turned out to be a movement, a movement like the world has never seen before actually.
You know, it's funny, I've said that so often, they don't even correct me. The, you know, fake media. They never correct me because it's true. Oh, believe me, if it's off by one hundredth of a percent, is like I end up getting Pinocchios, right? They don't even correct me. One of the great movements of all time.
Imagine -- and it's not my movement. It's a movement of the people. It's been something that has really been very special. I'm like a messenger. I'm nothing more than a messenger. I'm a messenger. [Applause]
I did a good job as a messenger but I'm a messenger. It's been a lot of fun, too. Imagine the breakthroughs that will breathe fresh life into forgotten places. Picture the new roads that will carve pathways all across our land. And we need them. And think of the new inventions that will lift up the sights of our nation.
Finally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad. [Applause] People don't realize, I have to say, what a mess we inherited, what we have. I'm telling you, you look at North Korea, you look at the Middle East, you look all over, you like the horrible, horrible, horrible Iran deal. I still have not been able to figure out why anybody would have signed that deal. I asked generals. I had them in my office. I said, general, please tell me why did they sign that deal. Unbelievable. But we're going to straighten things out, folks.
The best Republican presidents have not only been war fighters but also peacemakers. We will never hesitate to do what we must do keep us safe today, but we will always seek a more peaceful tomorrow. We will, and we will succeed. [Applause]
If we stand for these things -- safety, prosperity and peace -- then there is no limit to what we can achieve, a future where millions are lifted from welfare to work, and they're going to love it. They're going to love it. They're going to love waking up in the morning, going to work.
Communities thriving with jobs and searching with commerce. Inner cities filled with new hope and new opportunities. Schools where our children can learn free from violence and free from fear. [Applause]
And new frontiers in science, technology and space that inspire the next generation of American youth. All of this and so much more is possible. Our country is great. A new national pride is stirring our souls. New optimism is sweeping our land. A new era of American greatness is just beginning.
Somewhere in America tonight a child is born in poverty, looking up into the sky and filling their heart with dreams, big, beautiful, bold dreams. And if we make the right choices together then no one will ever have to tell that child that their dreams will have to wait for another day, another year or another decade. Because the waiting now is over. The time for action is now.
This is the moment when great deeds are done, and we will do those great deeds. By putting our faith in the people and by putting our trust in God, we will rise to this occasion like no one has ever risen before. [Applause]
Thank you so much. Thank you. Great people, great country. Thank you so much. We will prove worthy of this moment. Anything is possible if we stand together, united and strong. Not just as Republicans but as great and unified Americans. Join me in believing in this better and brighter future. Join me in building this reality, and join me in re- dedicating ourselves to the common good of this nation that we all love so much.
Together we will defend our freedoms, we will defend our people, and we will defend our great and beautiful American flag. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. [Applause]"
2017-03-20,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Louisville, Kentucky","Louisville, KY, United States","[-85.7584557, 38.2526647]",donald-trump-speech-louisville-ky-march-20-2017,"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [Applause] I am thrilled to be here in the great state of Kentucky and the beautiful city of Louisville! [Applause] And this place is packed! [Applause] There are a lot of people outside aren't getting in, but that's all right. We love them, too, right? We love them, too. [Applause]
We're in the heartland of America and there is no place I would rather be than here with you tonight. [Applause] Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, was born right here in Kentucky. [Applause] That's not bad. The legendary pioneer Daniel Boone helped settle the Kentucky frontier. [Applause]
And the great 19th century American statesman Henry Clay represented Kentucky in the United States Congress. [Applause] Henry Clay believed in what he called the American system and proposed tariffs to protect American industry and finance American infrastructure. [Applause]
I'm honored to be here today with many of your tremendous, modern-day leaders. [Applause] We're joined tonight -- and I want you to give him a nice hand because he's on our side, got to take good care of our people, right... [Applause] ...and he's got a lot of power for the people of Kentucky -- by our Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Where is he? Come here, Mitch. [Applause] Thank you, Mitch. How are you doing, Mitch? Hey, Mitch, are we going to be OK? Everything good? That health care is looking good? Good, thanks, Mitch. [Applause]
And we're also very lucky to have in my Cabinet our secretary of transportation, the wonderful Elaine Chao. [Applause] Working with Secretary Chao, we're going to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of the United States. [Applause] It's time, right? It's time. [Applause]
It is time. After spending trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, it is indeed time. We are going to start taking care of our country. [Applause] Also with us this evening is your great governor, Matt Bevin. Where's Matt? [Applause] Matt! Thanks, Matt.
Congressman Andy Barr and Congressman Jamie Comer. [Applause] The state motto of Kentucky is ""united we stand, divided we fall."" We are united. [Applause] Somebody from the fake media the other day asked me a question. [Booing]
They said, how are the Republicans going to finally get together? I said, wait a minute, we won the presidency, we won the House, we won the Senate. I mean, right? [Applause] Actually, he was a nice guy that asked the question, but I was sort of thinking that was an interesting question because we've just about never been on a streak like this. I think 1928, that's a long time ago, and we're going to get a lot of things done.
And then we're going to get to truly one of my favorite things. It's called reducing taxes. [Applause] Standing together as Americans we are going to deliver amazing things for the citizens of Kentucky and the United States. Most importantly, we are going to take power back from the political class in Washington and return that power to you the American people. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. [Applause]
It started on November 8th. Remember that beautiful, beautiful day? That beautiful day, we're going to give it back. [Applause] That was a beautiful day. They weren't giving us a lot of chance, were they? Remember? There is no path to 270, right? [Applause]
Remember the line? And, you know, for the Republicans, the Electoral College was very, very hard, very hard to win. Do you remember the famous line, there is no path to 270? Well, there was a path to 306, but maybe not to 270. [Applause]
But we have a lot of work to do. The fact is we inherited a mess. It's a mess. I met with the prime minister today of Iraq. I met with others, the Middle East, North Korea. [Booing] North Korea, I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful and not smart, not smart at all. So many different problems.
And I'll tell you, you see what's happening with the economy. We've picked up $3 trillion in value and our companies are bringing people back to work. [Applause]We have to take on every special interest that has profited from this. And, I mean, I don't mean, like, a little bit, I mean really terrible trade deals, horrible trade deals. Last year, our country lost almost $800 billion in trade. Not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore. [Applause]
Uncontrolled immigration, you see what's going on there. That's happening quickly. Got a little problem with the courts not wanting to give us the decisions that should be given. But we're going to win it.
And the financial system stacked against the American people. These entrenched interests will do anything they can to keep the broken system in place. But they will fail and we will win because we are fighting on this side of our great American heritage. [Applause]
This place is packed! [Applause]I mean, I don't want to say this, we could have been watching a good basketball game tonight. But what happened? What happened? That's all right. You've done a good job, right? You've done a good job. Great team, great coach. It's all right.
We are going to drain the swamp of government corruption in Washington, D.C. and we are going to keep our promises, all of the promises that we made. [Applause] We are going to massively reduce your taxes. [Applause]We are going to reduce very substantially rising crime and support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
We're going to bring accountability to the V.A. and take great care finally, finally, finally of our great veterans. [Applause] And our secretary, you wouldn't believe it, because I still don't have my Cabinet, they won't approve my Cabinet. [Booing]
There is a lot of division and a lot of bad stuff going on in this country. But I'll tell you -- David, we love David, David got approved 100-to-nothing, can you believe it? Head of the V.A., secretary of the V.A. [Applause]
And you watch what happens with the veterans. It's time. It's time we take care of our veterans. [Applause] We are going to rebuild the United States military finally. [Applause] I have proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history. And we need it. We need it. Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right? [Applause]
That's time also. And it's also jobs because we're going to make this equipment right here in the USA. [Applause] And we believe in three crucial words: Peace through strength. [Applause]
There's our great lieutenant governor, by the way, please. [Applause] Thank you, darling. Thank you. But we will spend our money wisely. With just one negotiation on one set of airplanes, I saved the taxpayers of our country over $700 million. [Applause]
And that's just one of many. One of many. We've also kept our promise to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [Applause]
Judge Neil Gorsuch's hearing is now under way in the Senate. And I urge members of both parties to swiftly approve his nomination. He is an outstanding man from an outstanding family with an unbelievably wonderful wife. They should approve.
There's another promise that is deeply important to me and I know it is deeply important to you. We are going to put our coal miners back to work. [Applause] They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now. Clean coal, right? Clean coal. I have already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation and that is just the beginning. You saw that.
We got a lot of thank yous from a lot of great people that worked very hard and want to keep working. A lot of people are going to be put back to work, a lot of coal miners are going back to work.
As we speak, we are preparing new executive actions to save our coal industry and to save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work. The miners are coming back. [Applause]
Our new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, a Kentucky native, will turn the EPA -- environmental -- will turn the EPA from a job killer into a job creator. You watch. [Applause] Since my Inauguration, we've already added nearly a half-a- million new jobs. And that's, believe me, just the beginning, just the beginning. [Applause]
And I don't know, did you see those consumer confidence levels? Matt, they're through the roof. I don't even know. I think you're doing as well in Kentucky, but I know you don't like Obamacare. I know. [Booing]
Great guy. We're working to remove regulations on our auto industry so we can make more cars right here in America, including more cars in Kentucky. [Applause] We've wiped out many, many unnecessary regulations and that's just the beginning. It's continuing on a weekly basis.
We're getting rid of unnecessary regulations. We're going to be good for business and we're going to be good for the workers of America. [Applause] We've also cleared the way for the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. [Applause]
And as I was signing it, I said, where are they getting the steel? Where? And I said, you know what, if people want to build pipelines in the United States, they should use American steel and they should build it and create it right here. That pipe is going to be manufactured right here. [Applause]
That was, like, the last minute. I'm saying, where are they buying this stuff? Like Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work. We believe in two simple rules: buy American and hire American. [Applause]
So as you folks all know, Henry Clay was a legendary Kentucky politician who became the eighth speaker of the House in 1811. You know, they compared my campaign to Jackson, President Jackson, right, of 1828. I said, can you imagine having to go back that far? And they said this was even more severe.
But we did a good job. Did we do a great job together? [Applause]1828, that's a long time ago. Oh, boy. And he was a good president, right? He was a good president. Clay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing. He wanted it badly. He said very strongly free trade, which would throw wide open our ports to foreign production, without duties while theirs remain closed to us. That was his quote.
He knew all the way back, early 1800s. Clay said that trade must be fair, equal and reciprocal. Boom, he said fair, equal and reciprocal. I'm talking about reciprocal trade -- reciprocal. [Applause]
I mentioned that the other day to a group in my office. We're going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the health care finished. Oh, I'm looking forward to these trade deals. They're the ones. Oh, there's going to be no ambiguity. But I use the word ""reciprocal.""
You know, Harley-Davidson makes great motorcycles. They were in my office. They were in my office. And they came in. I said, how are you doing? Great. How's business? Great. How do you do overseas? Well, it's tough. We have some countries that charge us a $100 import tax. I said a hundred -- a 100 percent. Think of it. They want a hundred dollars on that -- 100 percent. So I said, how do you do? Not so well, it's tough. They have other countries that charge a lot.
We want reciprocal. So if they're going to charge us a hundred percent, we're going to charge them a hundred percent. And you know what's going to happen? They're going to bring their hundred percent down to nothing like we charge. We can't allow that to happen. We can't allow that to happen. [Applause]
In explaining his American system, Clay argued that the sole object of the tariff is to tax the produce. And remember, to tax the produce of foreign industry with the view of promoting American industry. For too long, our government has abandoned the American system. Since NAFTA was approved in 1994, the worst trade deal ever made by any country, I think, in the world, America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs. Do not worry, we are starting on NAFTA very soon.
You know, I've only been there for, what, 52 days, right? [Applause] Somebody said to me, when are you starting on NAFTA? I said, wait a minute, I did this, this, this, I've knocked out unbelievable numbers of regulations, we're negotiating much better deals, these terrible deals that were made. I've been here, like, 51 days. Give me a chance. [Laughter]
Oh, I look forward. We're going to do something with NAFTA that you are going to be very, very impressed with. That's going to be an easy one, folks. That's going to be an easy one.
Since China joined, that's another beauty, the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has lost many more than 60,000 factories. We sacrificed our own middle class to finance the growth of foreign countries. But those days, ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, are over. Is that OK? [Applause]
Those days are over. It's crazy. You know what that is? Much more than 60,000 factories. You know what that is? It's, like, I said, if you have a map, how do you put that many dots on the map, right? More than 60,000 factories, but they're all coming back. You see them coming back. You see car companies that were going to build elsewhere and now they're saying that because of Trump we're going to build in Michigan, we're going to build in Ohio, we're going to build in Kentucky. [Applause]
They're saying it loud and clear. Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [Applause] We will be, I promise you, a rich nation once again. [Applause] And we will do what we have to do. And we will not allow other countries to take advantage of us like they've been doing to a level that's hard to believe. Hard to believe. Not going to happen.
Not going to happen anymore, Kentucky. Remember that, OK? [Applause] You just worry about your basketball team, I'll take care of the rest. [Applause] But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. That is why I am following through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the United States. [Applause]
We will build, that's right, a great, great border wall. [Applause] And, you know, it's already out to bid. You've probably been reading, tremendous numbers of bidders. What does that mean when you have a lot of bidders? It means we're going to get it for the right price, OK? Believe me. [Applause]
And we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others. We're going to stop the drugs. [Applause] A lot of them are coming in from the Southern border. Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the Southern border by 61 percent. Think of that. [Applause]
Sixty-one percent and we haven't started. And the courts are not making it easy, folks. They're not making it easy. [Booing] Terrible. Sixty-one percent. During the campaign as I've traveled all across this great country, I met with many American families whose loved ones, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, were viciously killed by illegal immigrants. Incredible. Incredible. These amazing American lives were stolen because our government refused to enforce our already-existing laws. [Booing]
These American victims and their families were ignored by the media. The media doesn't want to talk about it. [Booing]They don't want to talk about it. They were ignored by the consultants. They were ignored by Washington. But these Americans were not ignored by me. They were not ignored by you. You showed that on November 8th. They were not ignored by you and they will never be ignored by any of us. [Applause]
As we speak tonight, we are finding the drug dealers, robbers, thieves, gang members, predators, killers and criminals of all types preying on our citizens. You've been saying it, you've been reading about it and you've been seeing it. One by one they are being tracked down and thrown the hell out of our country and we will not let them back in. [Applause, Chanting] We are also working to protect our citizens from terrorism. [Applause]
We have seen the devastation at home from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino and many, many other places. We've seen attacks overseas in France, in Germany, in Belgium. It's time for intelligence and common sense to be used. [Applause]
The single-best way to protect, and you have to do this, you have to do this, and to keep foreign terrorists from attacking our country is to keep these foreign terrorists from entering our country in the first place. [Applause]
And we will stop radical Islamic terrorism. We will stop it. Not going to let it happen, not here. Not going to let it happen. [Applause]Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. And we're going to be working very closely with our leader, Mitch McConnell, to get that job done. Paul Ryan, everybody, they're going to be working very hard. And Congressman Andy Barr and Jamie Comer, I have to thank them for their help and their support as we move toward the crucial House vote on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's very painful passage.
This is our long- awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare. [Applause] It's a long-awaited chance. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. What's the alternative? The alternative is what you have. What you have is nothing, the worst, it's the big lie. And remember this, so true, I happen to like a lot Senator Rand Paul, I do. [Applause]
I do, I like him. He's good. He's a good guy. And I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed in some form so that we can pass massive tax reform which we can't do until this happens. So we've got to get this done before we can do the other. In other words, we have to know what this is before we can do the big tax cuts. We've got to get it done for a lot of reasons, but that's one of them. [Applause]
And it's important to realize how we got to Obamacare in the first place. Back in 2009 and 2010, House and Senate Democrats forced through a 2,700-page health care bill that no one read and no one understood. By the way, today it's thousands of pages more, it's not even understandable. They ignored the public, they ignored the voters and they jammed a massive, failed health care takeover right through Congress. [Booing]
And this is what we have. It's time for Democrat leaders in Washington to take responsibility for the disaster they and they alone created. [Applause] Remember when President Obama said if you like your plan you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor? [Booing]
Nobody brings that stuff up, do they? Do they ever bring it up? Matt, I don't think so, right? They don't bring it up. Notice how they forget all those things?
Or when the architect of Obamacare said the law was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Or Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- oh, he must have had a tough night when he went home that night... [Laughter]
... called Obamacare the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. Bill Clinton said that, the craziest thing in the world. Or the Democratic governor of Minnesota who said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.
It's been one broken promise after another. People have been kicked off their plans and their premiums have increased by double and triple digits. Arizona up 116 percent. By the way, insurance companies in a great state known as Kentucky -- have you ever heard of it -- are in tremendous trouble, will be fleeing and we're going to save it all. We're going to save it all. Tremendous trouble, it's a disaster. [Applause]
In fact, to counter my speech two weeks in Congress -- I don't know, did anybody see that speech -- they used the former governor of Kentucky. [Booing] And the plan doesn't work in Kentucky. But Matt will save us.
Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare. Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe and it's getting worse and worse by the day. And yet, you watch the fake media, the fake news and they try and build it up. It's a disaster, fellas. It's a disaster. [Booing]
What would be great if they told the truth about Obamacare. It would be so wonderful for the people of this country because it would just sail right through. Our plan would sail right through.
One-third of the counties in the United States now have only one Obamacare insurer left, some have none. And in your state it's worse. In a recent interview, your governor, Matt Bevin, who's right here so I better be careful, said that Obamacare was a disaster in Kentucky.
Is that right? I'm quoting that so accurately. And it is. It's been an absolute disaster. Half of our counties only have a single provider right now. It's a financial disaster waiting to happen right here in your own state. Thursday is our chance to end Obamacare and the Obamacare catastrophe and begin delivering the reforms our people deserve. [Applause]
Big thing. Then we get to tax cuts. Big thing. And remember, we're going to negotiate and it's going to go to the Senate and back and forth. The end result is going to be wonderful and it's going to work great.
Once this is done, we are also going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process. [Applause]
Some people think that's just as important as health care. The cost of medicine in this country is outrageous, many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere. Why? Same pill, same manufacturer, identical, and it's many times higher in the United States. You know why? Campaign contributions, who knows?
But somebody is getting very rich. We're going to bring it down and we're going to have a great, competitive bidding process. Medicine prices will be coming way down, way, way, way down. And that's going to happen fast. [Applause]
And we're just adding that to the bill. I said we've got to add that to the bill. We were going to do a bill later, we're trying to add it to this bill. And if we can't, we're going to have it right after.
We have some crazy arcane laws, folks, just in case you haven't heard. I am confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country, not just on health care, but all across our government.
And by the way, that Second Amendment is very, very safe right now. [Applause] I promised. I said we're going to save the Second Amendment. I promise you we are going to save the Second Amendment. It's very, very safe. It would not be in good shape if a certain other person won this election, I can tell you. You'd not be happy. [Booing]
And if they came to make a speech, 250 people would have shown up. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping across our land and a new national pride is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls. So true. [Applause]
Just imagine what we could accomplish if we stand together as a united American people. [Applause] Our economy will be unleashed and millions will be lifted from welfare to work. Got to work on work. They're going to love it. They're going to love it. From welfare to work.
Our children will grow up in safe communities and they will be educated in schools that teach them to love our country and its values. [Applause] Our inner cities will find a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity. [Applause]
And, you know, your San Francisco quarterback, I'm sure nobody ever heard of him. [Booing] I'm just reporting the news. There was an article today -- I love to report the news and then they said I made a mistake, right? I said, no, the people reporting the news made a mistake if it's wrong. But there was an article today, it was reported that NFL owners don't want to pick him up because they don't want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump.
Do you believe that? [Applause] I just saw that. I just saw that. I said, if I remember that one, I'm going to report it to the people of Kentucky because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag. Right? [Applause]
Our struggling industries are going to be revitalized and our dying factories will come roaring back to life. It's already happening. [Applause] And in our dealing with other nations, we will find a new era of security, cooperation and peace. And we won't be played for the fool and we won't be played for the suckers any longer. [Applause]
This is the future that awaits us if we embrace our destiny as Americans, which we did. This was one of the greatest things, one of the biggest events ever to happen in our country. And we're going to make it even better than anybody ever thought possible. That's happening already. [Applause]
We are one people and we share one faith. Whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood. [Applause] We all salute the same great American flag. [Applause] And we are all made by the same almighty God. [Applause]
As long as we remember these truths, we will not fail. Nobody, nobody can beat us, nobody! [Applause] We are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to you. This is your moment, this is your time and this, the United States of America, is your country again. [Applause]
So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, let us now recite these words. Are you ready? Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again! Thank you. Thank you, Kentucky. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-03-17,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-march-17-2017,"My fellow Americans, This week, I traveled to Nashville, Tennessee to lay a wreath at the grave of Andrew Jackson, on the 250th anniversary of his birth. Jackson was an American hero. First, as the brilliant general whose crushing defeat of the British at New Orleans saved our independence in the War of 1812.
And later, as the seventh President of the United Stateswhen he fought to defend the forgotten men and women from the arrogant elite of his day. Does it sound familiar?
The memory of his leadership lives on in our people, and his spirit points us to a better future. This week, I also traveled to the Willow Run plant in Michigan. At that facility during the Second World War, the Ford Motor Company built not cars, but entire airplanes. At one point, workers there produced a complete B-24 Liberator every single hour  hard to believe.
Today on that site is a new facility, where the cutting edge cars of the future will be tested. And this week, the old plant was filled once again with thousands of workers and engineers. I was there to share the good news for the American auto industry.
We announced we'll be reversing an 11th hour executive action from the previous Administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America. And I mean threatening  it was very, very sad to see.
In fact, we are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify any unnecessary regulation that is hurting American businesses and American jobs. The first two job reports of my administration show that we've already added nearly half a million new jobs.
The days of economic surrender for the United States are over. For too long, special interests have made money shipping jobs overseas.  We need a new economic model  let's call it the American Model.
Under this model, we will lower the burden on American Business but, in exchange, they must hire and grow America and American jobs.  This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers. Let's buy American and hire American. Let's create jobs in America. Let's imagine new industries. And let's build a beautiful future together.
Among the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard of her: they called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie's country called her, she answered the call.
Rosie was famous for her toughness and her strengthand for the words that were emblazoned above her famous image. It said very simply: ""We can do it."" If Americans unite, and find again within our nation the soul of Rosie and the spirit of JacksonI have no doubt that we can do it, and do it like never before. Thank you. Enjoy your week."
2017-03-15,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Nashville, Tennessee","Nashville, TN, United States","[-86.7816016, 36.1626638]",donald-trump-speech-nashville-march-15-2017,"Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [Applause] So we're just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up. This is some crowd. You have to see what's outside, you wouldn't even believe it. [Applause] Unbelievable.
So I'm thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home -- [Applause] -- of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson. [Applause] I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson's home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth. Jackson's life was devoted to one very crucial principle -- he understood that real leadership means putting America first. [Applause]
Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia. Tough cookie. Tough cookie. [Applause]
So let's begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans. The veterans. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
Amazing. There's no place I'd rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country. [Applause] I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly -- or reporters from Washington, D.C. [Applause]
It's patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well. You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars. [Applause] All you want is a government that shows you the same loyalty in return. It's time that Washington heard your voice -- and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice. [Applause] The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me. [Applause]
I want to thank so many of your state leaders -- State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan -- right from the beginning. [Applause] Governor Bill Haslam. [Applause] A great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker. [Applause] An incredible guy, respected by all -- Senator Lamar Alexander. [Applause] And so many more. Thank you all for being here.
We're going to be working closely together to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like you've never been delivered for before. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. We're going to reduce your taxes -- big league. Big. [Applause] Big. I want to start that process so quickly. Got to get the healthcare done. We got to start the tax reductions. [Applause]
We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world. They're coming back to our country. [Applause] We're going to support the amazing -- absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] Protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment. [Applause] And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag. [Applause]
It's been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we've been putting our America First agenda very much into action. You see what's happening. We're keeping our promises. In fact, they have signs -- ""He's Kept His Promise."" They're all over the place. I have. [Applause] We have done far more -- I think maybe more than anybody's done in this office in 50 days, that I could tell you. [Applause]
And we have just gotten started. Wait until you see what's coming, folks. We've appointed a Supreme Court justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. [Applause] He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy -- and I mean bloated -- while protecting our national security. You see what we're doing with our military -- bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You see what's happening. [Applause] And you're already seeing the results. Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country. [Applause]
We believe -- especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well -- [Applause] -- in peace through strength. That's what we're going to have. And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share. They have to pay. [Applause] We've begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before -- slash, slash. We're going to protect the environment, we're going to protect people's safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we're going to bring it down to where it should be. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
Okay, let's go. One person -- and they'll be the story tomorrow -- did you hear there was a protestor? [Applause]
We're going to put our miners back to work. We're going to put our auto industry back to work. Already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven't seen in many, many decades. [Applause]
In the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it's just beginning. [Applause] I've already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. [Applause] A lot of jobs.
I've also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel. [Applause] They want to build them here, they use our steel. We believe in two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. [Applause]
On trade, I've kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster. [Applause] Tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history. Our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization -- 60,000. Think of that. More than that.
We're not going to let it happen anymore. From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies. [Applause] And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I've been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks. Not even close. [Applause]
If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences. [Applause] That's what we have borders for. And by the way, aren't our borders getting extremely strong? [Applause] Very strong.
USA! USA! USA!
Don't even think about it. We will build the wall. Don't even think about it. [Applause] In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid. We had hundreds of bidders. Everybody wants to build our wall. [Applause] Usually, that means we're going to get a good price. We're going to get a good price, believe me. [Applause] We're going to build the wall.
Some of the fake news said, I don't think Donald Trump wants to build the wall. Can you imagine if I said we're not going to build a wall? Fake news. Fake, fake news. Fake news, folks. A lot of fake.
No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are. It's under design, and you're going to see some very good things happening. But the border by itself right now is doing very well. It's becoming very strong. General Kelly has done a great job -- General Kelly.
My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States. Our southern border will be protected always. It will have the wall. Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon. You're already seeing what's going on. The drugs are pouring into our country, folks. They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we're going to stop it. We're not going to playing games. Not going to be playing games. [Applause] Following my executive action -- and don't forget, we've only been here for like -- what? -- 50 days -- we've already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day -- 61 percent. Think about it.
And now people are saying, we're not going to go there anymore because we can't get in. So it's going to get better and better. We got to stop those drugs, though. We got to stop those drugs.
During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws. These American victims were ignored by the media. They were ignored by Washington. But they were not ignored by me, and they're not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer. Not going to happen. [Applause]
As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens. One by one -- you're reading about it, right? They're being thrown out of our country. They're being thrown into prisons. And we will not let them back in. [Applause]
We're also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism. [Applause] We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino -- hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts. Right now we have investigations going on all over -- hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons. We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS. For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur. [Applause]
But let me give you the bad news. We don't like bad news, right? I don't want to hear -- and I'll turn it into good. But let me give you the bad, the sad news. Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii -- part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court -- and I have to be nice; otherwise I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts. I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world -- I will be criticized -- I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts. I would never want to do that. A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
Booo --
The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with. This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's -- in my opinion -- flawed ruling. This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach. The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems -- or she -- or she. Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she. [Applause] When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.
So we have a lot of lawyers here. We also have a lot of smart people here. Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration -- and you know what I'm talking about, right? Can I read this to you? Listen to this. Now, we're all smart people. We're all good students -- some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you. Ready?
So here's the statute -- which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it. And it was put here for the security of our country. And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this. And sometimes we need it very badly for security -- security of our country.
It says -- now, listen how easy this is. ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he -- see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she. You know, today they'd say that. Actually, that's the only mistake they made. ""as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."" In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she -- whoever is President -- can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please. We've got enough problems. [Applause]
We're talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people. [Applause] Now, I know you people aren't skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee. Right? Nobody -- not Tennessee. You don't think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you? No.
Booo --
This ruling makes us look weak -- which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me. [Applause] Just look at our borders. We're going to fight this terrible ruling. We're going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court. [Applause] We're going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe. And regardless, we're going to keep our citizens safe, believe me. [Applause] Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz ---- good lawyer -- just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States. [Applause]
Remember this, I wasn't thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let's tailor it. This is a watered--down version of the first one. This is a watered--down version. And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one. [Applause]
The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear. I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless. [Applause] And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me. Not today, not ever. We're going to win it. We're going to win it. [Applause]
We're going to apply common sense. We're going to apply intelligence. And we're never quitting, and we're never going away, and we're never, ever giving up. The best way to keep foreign terrorists -- or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists -- from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place. [Applause]
We'll take it, but these are the problems we have. People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit. And I'll tell you what, that 9th Circuit -- you have to see. Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions. Take a look. And this is what we have to live with.
Finally, I want to get to taxes. I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but -- [Applause] -- but before I can do that -- I would have loved to have put it first, I'll be honest -- there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare. [Applause]
If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you're down to practically no insurers. You're going to have nobody. You're going to have nobody. And this is true all over. The insurers are fleeing. The insurers are fleeing. It's a catastrophic situation, and there's nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won't be around for a year or two. It's gone. So it's not like, oh, gee, they have this. Obamacare is gone.
Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases. It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs. Remember all of the broken promises? You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Remember the wise guy -- remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people -- the so--called architect -- the American people are stupid because they approved it? We're going to show them.
Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare. [Applause] And remember this -- remember this: If we took, because there's such divisiveness -- and I'm not just talking now, with me. There was with Obama. There was with Bush. The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians. I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington -- I* was always very politically active -- and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day and they go to dinner at night. Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.
Just remember this: If we submitted the Democrats' plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats. That's the way it is. That's how much divisiveness and other things there are. So it's a problem. But we're going to get it by.
So, I've met with so many victims of Obamacare ---- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation. At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw -- the government forcing people to buy a government--approved product. There are very few people -- very few people.
Booo --
By the way -- watch what happens. Now you just booed Obamacare. They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned -- they're bad people, folks. They're bad people.
Booo --
Tonight, I'll go home, I'll turn on, I'll say -- listen, I'll turn on that television. My wife will say, darling, it's too bad you got booed. I said, I didn't get booed. This was a -- I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare. Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed. But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it. So we'll see. It's the fake, fake media. We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government. [Applause]
The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together and we're going to get something done. Remember this -- if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved. They won't vote, no matter what we do, they're not going to vote. So we're doing it a different way, a complex way. It's fine. The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three -- it's going to be great. It's going to be great.
And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like. [Applause] The House legislation does so much for you. It gives the states Medicaid flexibility. And some of the states will take over their healthcare. Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money -- they run a great plan. We have states that are doing great. It gives great flexibility.
Thank you, folks. Thank you. [Applause] It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes. It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs. The bill that I will ultimately sign -- and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we're going to get it done -- we'll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family. [Applause]
And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three -- I'm going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process. [Applause]
We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we're going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day -- unlike the way Obamacare was passed. Remember, folks, if we don't do anything, Obamacare is gone. It's not like, oh, gee, it's going to be wonderful in three years. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. Not working. It's gone. What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don't believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions. [Applause]
I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country -- not just on healthcare, but all across our government. We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine. We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values. [Applause] We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we're going to lower taxes. [Applause]
And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing. [Applause]
No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home. We all salute the same flag. And we all are made by the same God. [Applause]
USA! USA! USA!
It's time to embrace our glorious American destiny. Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country. All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls. And we found that out very recently in our last election -- a lot of pride. [Applause] We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. This is your moment. This is your time. This is the hour when history is made. All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again. [Applause] We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [Applause]
Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. [Applause] God bless you, everybody. [Applause]"
2017-03-15,"Speech: Donald Trump at The American Center for Mobility - Ypsilanti, MI","Ypsilanti, MI, United States","[-83.61299389999999, 42.2411499]",donald-trump-speech-acm-ypsilanti-mi-march-15-2017,"Thank you very much. It is truly great to be back here in Michigan -- great. [Applause] And it's also wonderful to be here with the leaders, workers, engineers and suppliers of Ford, and Fiat-Chrysler, and General Motors, and many others. We have so many leaders that we just met, all of the leaders of the major car companies and really the automobile business. It's a great business, it's a wonderful business, but it's been pretty much hurt here. But it's not going to be hurt for long, that I can tell you. [Applause] That I can tell you.
I'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work on the CAFE standards, so you can make cars in America again. [Applause] We're going to help the companies, and they're going to help you.
There is no more beautiful sight than an American-made car. No more beautiful sight. [Applause] I love this state, I love the people of this state. And you did me a big favor, because you gave me a victory, and that victory hasn't been won by a Republican in a long time -- long time. [Applause] And you're going to be very happy, believe me. You're going to be very, very happy.
During the campaign, I came to Michigan again and again, and I made this promise, that I am going to fight for your jobs and fight very, very hard. [Applause] I'm going to fight for Michigan workers. I'm going to fight to keep the automobile production in the United States of America, not outside -- in the United States. [Applause] And, by the way, for those that have any doubts, many other industries do. That's okay, right?
So we're here not simply to honor the past, but to devote ourselves to a new future of American automotive leadership. We want to be the car capital of the world again. We will be. And it won't be long, believe me. [Applause] And, by the way, we're going to have a very big announcement next week having to do with your industry. Very, very big. Very important. Everybody is saying, ""what is it?"" Let's keep them guessing back there. [Laughter]
You've heard me say the words, and I'll repeat them, right now: Buy American and Hire American. [Applause] It's not just a motto, it's a pledge. It's a pledge to the working people of this country. The era of economic surrender for the United States is over -- it's over. And you see what's already been happening: plants are coming back; other plants that were expected to be built in other countries are not being built. I just want to tell the leaders they made some very wise decisions. Very wise. Very wise. [Applause] Some plants that were announced, they're not going to be built. They're smart.
We're going to stand up to foreign cheating. We're going to crack down on currency manipulation. And, yes, we're going to use the full economic powers of our country to protect our workers and to protect our jobs.
Let me also say how important it is for me that we have every segment of this great American industry represented in our audience today. We have everybody. To succeed as a country, we have to work together. We have to fight, side-by-side, to protect our industry and to stop the jobs from leaving our country. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. We've gone through it for many, many years, decades. It's not going to happen anymore. And if it is, there's consequences to pay for the companies that desert us and fire our employees. There are consequences. [Applause]
Already, we're seeing jobs coming back. Since my election, Ford has announced 700 new jobs coming back to their plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. [Applause] Fiat-Chrysler has announced that they will create 2,000 new jobs in Michigan and Ohio. [Applause] And just today -- breaking news -- General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan, and that's going to be over the next 12 months. And that's just the beginning, folks. In fact, I told them, that's peanuts -- that's peanuts. [Applause] We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants.
My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes, and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers.
Before NAFTA went into effect -- by the way, NAFTA, a total disaster -- there were 280,000 autoworkers in Michigan. Today, that number is roughly 165,000 -- and would have been heading down big league if I didn't get elected, I will tell you that right now. That I can tell you. [Applause] Plenty of things were stopped in their tracks. They were stopped in their tracks. A lot of bad things were going to happen. A lot of places were going to get built that aren't going to get built right now in other locations.
The number of auto plants in the state has been cut by a third. Motor City once set the standard of living for the nation. Now it has suffered under decades of failed economic decisions that have stripped our country of its jobs and of its wealth.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another disaster -- threatened states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and so many others with the loss of countless more jobs. That is why I'm proud to say I followed through on my promise -- and, by the way, many other promises. You've seen what's happened. Many. [Applause] And immediately withdrew the United States from the TPP. I kept my word. The assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over. It's over. [Applause] Not going to happen anymore.
We are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production and any other kind of production, including the production of high-end, low-end, big, small, every form of automobile and truck.
During my first week in office, I brought American auto companies to the White House. Mary Barra is here. Mark Fields is here. Sergio is here, and others. And none of them ever got to see the Oval Office before, because nobody took them into the Oval Office -- our Presidents. They employ tens of thousands of people, but I brought them into the Oval Office because they're going to be expanding their companies. [Applause]
But they all told me the same thing. They explained that the previous administration promised you a so-called ""mid-term review"" of the federal fuel efficiency standards. It was necessary because the standards were set far into the future -- way, way into the future. If the standards threatened auto jobs, then commonsense changes could have and should have been made.
Just days before my inauguration, the previous administration cut short the promised mid-term review in an 11th-hour executive action. Today, I am announcing that we are going to cancel that executive action. [Applause] We are going to restore the originally scheduled mid-term review, and we are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories. We're going to be fair. We're going to be fair.
This is an issue of deep importance to me. For decades, I have raised the alarm over unfair foreign trade practices that have robbed communities of their wealth and robbed our people of their ability to provide for their families. They've stolen our jobs, they've stolen our companies, and our politicians sat back and watched, hopeless. Not anymore.
As a private citizen, I looked, really with sadness, as massive shipments of foreign cars have been dumped onto our shores while those same countries have shut their borders to our cars. We take them -- ""Come on in, folks. Come on in. No tax. Don't worry about it."" We make cars; they don't take us. Not anymore. [Applause]
Since NAFTA was approved, we've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs in the United States. Since China entered the World Trade Organization, we've lost 60,000 factories. Hard to believe. Our trade deficit last year reached nearly $800 billion. Who's making these deals? I can take anybody in the audience -- you'll do better, believe me. [Laughter]
These statistics really should have shaken up Washington to do action, but nothing happened. But something did happen -- happened on November 8th. Believe me, it happened. It happened for you. [Applause]
But the politicians made excuses. They have said these chronic trade deficits have helped us to win friends abroad. I don't want friends abroad if that's what it's going to take. We don't need friends abroad for that. Do you ever see that, where they said, ""No, no, it's good for us because people like us abroad""? They don't like us -- they think we're stupid people. [Laughter]
But no friendship is strengthened through economic abuse -- because we have been abused. And no country can long lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders. [Applause] America will be respected again, and you, as workers, will be respected again. Believe me, you will be respected again. Soon. Now. I think it's already happened.
Our great Presidents, from Washington to Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln, all understood that a great nation must protect its manufacturing, must protect itself from the outside. Today, I will be visiting the home of Andrew Jackson on the 250th anniversary of his birth. And they say my election was most similar to his -- 1828. That's a long time ago. Usually they go back like to this one, or that one, 12 years ago, 16. I mean, 1828, that's a long way. That's a long time ago.
In supporting tariffs, Jackson said, ""I look at the tariff with an eye to the proper distribution of labor, and to revenue, and with a view to discharge our national debt."" We owe $20 trillion -- $20 trillion with our policies. America cannot be a wealthy country if special interests game the system to profit from the exodus of our companies and from the exodus of our jobs.
We must embrace a new economic model. Let's call it ""The American Model."" [Applause]
Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses. But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America. They have to hire and grow in our country. That is how we will succeed and grow together -- American workers and American industry side-by-side. Nobody can beat us, folks. Nobody can beat us. [Applause] Because whether we are rich or poor, young or old, black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. [Applause]
Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy -- including the legendary Rosie the Riveter, who worked here at Willow Run. You know that. [Applause] Seventy-five years ago, during the Second World War, thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplanes -- the B-24 Liberator. At peak production -- listen to this -- it's not the country that we've been watching over the last 20 years -- they were building one B-24 every single hour. [Applause] We don't hear that. We don't hear that anymore, do we? We'll be back. We'll be back soon. Most amazing people.
And while that's incredible, it's a tribute really to the teamwork, determination, and patriotism that lives on today in each and every one of you. Great people. You're great people.
Now, these hundreds of acres that defended our democracy are going to help build the cars and cities of the future. [Applause] So I ask you -- that's fine because you're right -- [Laughter] -- so I ask you today to join me in daring to believe that this facility, this city, and this nation will once again shine with industrial might. [Applause]
I am asking you to place your faith in the American worker and these great American companies. [Applause] I'm also asking you to respect and place your faith in companies from foreign lands that come here to build their product. We love them too, right? We love them too. [Applause]
I'm asking all of the companies here today to join us in this new Industrial Revolution. Let us put American workers, American families, and American dreams first once again.
May God bless the American worker. May God bless the Motor City. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, everybody."
2017-03-10,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-weekly-address-march-10-2017,"My fellow Americans, In March, we celebrate Women's History Month, honoring the countless contributions that women leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs have made throughout American history.
We are a greater, stronger, and more just Nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others.
We honor them and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today. On my 50th day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our nation - healthcare.
Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they would have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was.
Now we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises. Americans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, they've gone up by more than $4,000.
Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices. Instead, the number of plans to choose from has plummeted - and I mean plummeted. This year, Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges - or, in effect, no real choice at all.
Americans were promised that if they liked their health insurance and their doctors, they could keep them. Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance and lost the doctor that they liked and were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage.
Through seven long years of botched rollouts, soaring costs, cancelled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief. And relief is what we are determined to give them. I want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity.
The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our healthcare system all the way down with it. If we do nothing, millions more innocent Americans will be hurt - and badly hurt.
That's why we must repeal and replace Obamacare. House Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower states and consumers.
You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family. The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress - expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing healthcare access for all.
This plan is part of a three-pronged reform process. In concert with the plan in front of Congress, I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care.
We are also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines. You've heard me say that many, many times during the debates. I encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the healthcare system for the American people. Also, we will be driving down the costs.
We will deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people. Thank you very much."
2017-03-03,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Newport News, VA, United States","[-76.4730122, 37.0870821]",donald-trump-weekly-address-march-3-2017,"My fellow Americans, I'm joining you today from the deck of what will be our Nation's newest aircraft carrier, the soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford, and as you can see, I'm wearing a jacket and a hat that they just gave me. Not really used to it, but it feels awfully good â I'm very proud of it actually.
Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea. This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come.
A famous aviator once wrote that, to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a ""desire for the vast and endless sea."" So true.
In the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country, and rebuild it we will. On Tuesday, before a Joint Session to Congress, I laid out a vision â I hope you all watched â for how to accomplish that national rebuilding.
My vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military. We must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen the tools, equipment, resources and training they need to get the job done, and get it done right - especially in these very dangerous times.
The active duty Army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer active duty marines. The Air Force, it's the smallest it has been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly thirty years old, if you can believe that.
Our Navy's fleet is the smallest it has been since World War I, and that's a long time ago. Frontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky.
We cannot afford to continue down this path. My budget will give America's armed forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges â and meet them, we will.
Investing in the military means investing in peace - because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it. Most importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform. They are the best of us. They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known - and we will support them every single step of the way.
These are truly exciting times. Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us - to strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs. If we all work together, and put our country first, then anything is possible. Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal.
May God bless the men and women of our military, and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love."
2017-02-28,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses a Joint Session of Congress,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-congress-february-28-2017,"Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States... [Applause] ...and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done.
Recent threats... [Applause] Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.
Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter... [Applause] ...of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. [Applause]
All the nations of the world â friend or foe â will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.
For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.
We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross [Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well.], and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again. [Applause]
Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.
Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.
Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. [Applause]
Thank you. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. [Applause]
The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic â and it is a fantastic â new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.
We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers.
We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials â and a lifetime ban... [Applause]
Thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency... [Applause] ... and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. [Applause]
We're going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. [Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.] [Applause] We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines... [Applause] ... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. [Fact check: This needs context.] And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. [Applause]
We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. [Applause]
To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. [Fact check: True, but they don't do much.] [Applause]
We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. [Applause] At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. [Applause]
By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages [Fact check: Maybe a little.], help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. [Applause] We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.
We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders. [Applause] For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. [Applause]
As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. [Fact check: Not a big change.] Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? [Applause]
Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. [Applause]
According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.
It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. [Applause]
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. [Applause] That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm. [Applause]
As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. [Applause]
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel. [Applause]
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution. [Applause]
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. [Applause] Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.
To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. [Applause]
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. [Fact check: This is misleading.] Over 43 million people are now living in poverty. [Fact check: True â but the number has also fallen.] And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. [Fact check: The number is correct.]
More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.
We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved [Fact check: Not because of Nafta.], and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country. [Applause]
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. [Applause]
It will be a big, big cut.
At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers â have to do it. [Applause]
Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.
I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. [Applause]
And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, ""No, thank you."" [Laughter] At our meeting, I asked them, ""How are you doing? How is business?"" They said that it's good. I asked them further, ""How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?""
They told me â without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it â that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
They weren't even asking for a change. But I am. I believe... [Applause] I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade.
The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that ""the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."" Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [Applause]
I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken â advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country no longer. [Applause] I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. [Applause]
The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system. [Applause]
It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.
According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [Fact check: This needs context.] Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed. [Applause]
I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.
If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. [Applause]
Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. [Applause]
America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. [Applause]
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs. [Applause]
This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American. [Applause] Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare... [Applause]... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care. [Applause]
Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country. [Applause]
The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do. [Applause]
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. [Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.] As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.
One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast. They're leaving. And many Americans have no choice at all. There's no choice left.
Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing [Fact check: This is an exaggeration.], and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. [Applause]
Action is not a choice; it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. [Applause]
Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.
First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges. [Applause]
Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government. [Applause]
Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. [Applause]
Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. [Applause]
And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines... [Applause] ... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.
Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right? [Applause]
On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people. [Applause] My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave... [Applause] ... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. [Applause]
True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan... [Applause]
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame. [Applause]
Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.
If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A. but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan. [Applause] In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind â and the souls â of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. [Applause]
I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. [Applause] These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. [Applause]
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning â great learning center â with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. [Applause]
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. [Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.] In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. [Applause]
Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job. [Applause] But to create this future, we must work with â not against â not against â the men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's â really, it's what it is, division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media [Fact check: They have received coverage.] and silenced by special interests. Joining us... [Applause]
Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.
But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you. [Applause]
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands â Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis â were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. [Applause]
To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory. [Applause]
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war â if they must â they have to fight and they only have to win. [Applause]
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester... [Applause] ... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them. [Applause]
The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. [Applause] We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. [Applause]
I just spoke to our great General [Jim] Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.""
Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record. [Applause]
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan. [Applause]
To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.
We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism... [Applause] ... and a Cold War and defeated communism. [Applause]
But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. [Applause]
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost â have to do that. We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations. And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also. [Applause]
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. [Applause]
But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world. All across the world.
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding. [Applause]
America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.
On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year. [Applause]
Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear â schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow â are not too much to ask. [Applause]
When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same God. [Applause]
When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.
From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States."
2017-02-27,Speech: Donald Trump Addresses the National Governors Association Meeting,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-governors-february-27-2017,"Thank you very much. [Applause] That is pretty good, I'll tell you. Coming from governors, I can't really -- I can't even believe it. That's so impressive. And I very much appreciate you being here. And thank you to Vice President Pence. He has been so wonderful to work with. He's a real talent, a real guy. And he is central casting, do we agree? Central casting. He's been great. [Applause]
Good morning, everybody, and welcome back to the White House. The First Lady and I were very, very happy last night to host you. We saw some real talent, military talent, musicians who were fantastic. And everybody enjoyed it. [Applause]
I'm very proud to have so many former governors in my Cabinet. Vice President Pence, as you know, big governor from a very great state -- I state I like very much -- Indiana. Nikki Haley at the U.N. -- is Nikki here someplace? I think so -- yes. We have Rick Perry -- is going before. We're trying to get people approved, we can't get them out. But Rick is going to do a fantastic job. Sonny Purdue will be joining the Cabinet very soon. Terry Branstad will be our ambassador to China. And an interesting story on Terry -- every time I spoke in Iowa, he'd say, please don't say anything bad about China. [Laughter] I said, what do you mean? What do you mean? He said, I like China and we do a lot of business with China. ""And really, just don't"" -- and I said, ""hmm."" So when it came down to picking an ambassador, I called him up, I said, you like China. And I can tell you, China is very, very happy with our choice. So we made everybody happy. [Applause] Right? These governors -- thank you. And thank you, Terry.
These governors have been bold reformers, and their success shows why we need to make states the laboratories of democracy once again. Many of you have shared past frustrations with waiting for permission from the federal government and agencies -- and I understand that, and I've had many people tell me about it, and it's been catastrophic for some of your states. You know your citizens and you know they want things done. But they don't get things done and it's not your fault. Sometimes it's your fault, but they understand that. But sometimes it's not your fault. We're going to speed it up.
Because that's not how a partnership is supposed to work. The government should not stand in your way in delivering needed reforms and services -- and it won't. We're going to move very, very quickly, environmentally, with Scott and so many others that are involved in the process of regulation. We are going to be cutting -- we're going to be doing the right thing. We're going to be protecting people environmentally and safety-wise, but we're going to be moving it quickly, very quickly. [Applause]
And speaking of that, I know many of you -- and I've spoken to some of you last night about it -- have many projects that are -- I mean, just literally tied up because of environmental concerns, and it's been in for years and years and years the project your state wants, great for employment -- everybody wants them -- and they couldn't get them out of environmental protection. And we will get them out. Now, that doesn't mean they're going to be approved, but they'll be rejected quickly one way or the other. They'll be either rejected quickly or they're going to get approved. I would say most will be approved, but you're going to know you're not going to wait nine years or eleven years -- some of the horror stories that I've heard.
Under my administration, we're going to have a true partnership of collaboration and cooperation. We will get to the answers and we will get them quickly, and the flexibility you need to implement the reforms that you are going to have in order to make decision-making proper and decision-making fast. So we're going to do both those things -- proper and fast.
One of the most important responsibilities for the federal government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget, very much based on those two with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it. [Applause]
And you'll be hearing about that tomorrow night in great detail. This is a landmark event, a message to the world, in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve. We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight in our name only do one thing: Win. We have to win. We have to start winning wars again.
I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say ""we haven't lost a war"" -- we never lost a war -- you remember. Some of you were right there with me, and you remember we never lost a war. America never lost. And now we never win a war. We never win. And we don't fight to win. We don't fight to win. So we either got to win, or don't fight it at all. But where we are -- 17 years -- almost 17 years of fighting in the Middle East. I saw a chart the other day -- as of about a month ago, $6 trillion we've spent in the Middle East -- $6 trillion. And I want to tell you, that's just unacceptable. And we're nowhere. Actually, if you think about it, we're less than nowhere. The Middle East is far worse than it was 16, 17 years ago. There's not even a contest. So we've spent $6 trillion. We have a hornet's nest. It's a mess like you've never seen before. We're nowhere. So we're going to straighten it out.
This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government. We're going to do more with less. I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices. I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved -- they said they'd never seen anything like this before.
On one plane, on a small order of one plane, I saved $725 million. And I would say I devoted about, if I added it up, all those calls, probably about an hour. So I think that might be my highest and best use. [Laughter] Because if we can do that, our budget will be -- might be my highest and best. [Applause]
And there are many other places; it's all the same. And in one way, that's a good thing because we have an answer. And David is going to do a fantastic job at the VA. I see David is sitting there, shaking his head. Stand up, David. [Applause] So we can't get our people through Cabinet, but he went through -- was it 95 to nothing?
A hundred to zero.
How the hell did you do that? [Laughter] Boy, oh boy. He must be good. You were the one. One hundred to zero, wow. Chose you -- hey, we can do it. But we do -- we have still quite a few Cabinet members, and they're just in limbo waiting and waiting. It's like obstruction. It's obstruction. But eventually we'll get them, and they'll put their people in, and we'll get those agencies, et cetera, to work.
We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people. We can do so much more with the money we spend. With $20 trillion in debt -- can you imagine that -- the government must learn to tighten its belt, something families all across the country have had to learn to do, unfortunately. But they've had to learn to do it, and they've done it well.
My budget increases spending, and the increase in all spending, for federal law enforcement also. And activities having to do with law enforcement will be substantially increased. And we will fight violent crime. If you look at what's happening in our cities, you look at what's happening in Chicago, what's going on in Chicago -- we will fight violent crime, and we will win. And we'll win that one fairly quickly. Once we give the local police, the local law enforcement the right to go in and fight it, and we back them monetarily and also otherwise, we're going to win that one. We're going to win it fairly quickly, I believe.
My budget also puts America first by keeping tax dollars in America to help veterans and first responders. So important. This budget follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals, and putting violent offenders behind bars, or removing them from our country altogether. And I must say that we've been treated very well -- very, very well -- on the job that General Kelly has done at the border. It's tough, it's strong.
I was talking last night to Terry McAuliffe, and he said, you have to mention this -- because he met with -- where is Terry? He's around here someplace. Terry -- he met with General Kelly, and I think I can say you were impressed with General Kelly. And he said, you have to get the point out that they're removing the bad ones. And that's where our focus is -- it's the bad ones. We're getting some very, very bad players out of this country -- drug lords, gang members, heads of gangs, killers, murderers -- we're getting them out. That's what we're focused on.
The press isn't covering that, unfortunately, but it's something that is very important. We're getting the bad ones out. And that's always where I said I was going to start. I was going to start with these bad players. And they are bad. They are rough and tough, and we're getting them the hell out of our country, and we're bringing them to where they started out. Let their country do what they have to do with them.
So the budget, which is going to be a very big part of tomorrow night's speech, it's going to be I think a budget of great rationality. But it's going to have to do with military, safety, economic development, and things such as that. Great detail tomorrow night.
We're also going to do whatever we can to restore the authority of the states when that is the appropriate thing to do. We're going to give you back a lot of the powers that have been taken away from states and great people and great governors. And you can control it better than the federal government because you're right on top of it. You have something that's controllable. So I think that's going to be very important. You see that already taking effect.
We have to let the states compete and to see who has the best solutions. They know the best how to spend their dollars and how to take care of the people within each state. And the states are different, and people are different. So the governors are going to have a lot more decision-making ability than they have right now.
All states will benefit from our economic agenda. We will reduce taxes very, very substantially, and simplify the tax code. We're also going to make taxes between countries much more fair. We're one of the only countries in the world that people can sell their product into us and have no tax, no nothing, and they get rich. And yet if you want to do business with them, you'll have taxes, I've seen, as high as 100 percent. So they sell into us, no problem; we sell into them -- because we don't sell them because the tax is so high that they don't want us to sell into them.
So I know that's always been a point of contention, but to me it's just fair. It's just fair. It's reciprocal. It's fair. And so we're going to be doing a lot of work on that, and that's becoming a very, very important factor -- fairness. Because I believe in free trade. I want so much trade -- somebody said, oh, maybe he's a total nationalist -- which I am, in a true sense -- but I want trade. I want great trade between countries.
But the word ""free"" is very deceiving, because it's good for them, it's not good for us. I want fair trade. And if we're going to be taxed, they should be taxed at the same amount, the other countries. And one of two things is going to happen: We're going to make a lot of money or the other country is going to get rid of its tax. And that's good, too, because now the product, like Harley-Davidson -- I was talking to them -- the product will now flow into other countries where right now they can't do it.
So we're going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure, and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure. We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads. I have a friend who is in the trucking business. He said, my trucks are destroyed going from New York to Los Angeles. They're destroyed. He said, I'm not going to get the good trucks. He always prided himself on buying the best equipment. He said, the roads are so bad that, by the time we make the journey from New York to Los Angeles or back, he said the equipment is just beat to hell. I said, when has it been like that before? He said, it's never -- he's been in the business for 40 years -- he said it's never been like that. Forty years -- never been like that. So we're going to take care of that.
Infrastructure -- we're going to start spending on infrastructure big. And it's not like we have a choice. It's not like, oh, gee, let's hold it off. Our highways, our bridges are unsafe. Our tunnels -- I mean, we have tunnels in New York where the tiles are on the ceiling, and you see many tiles missing. And you wonder, you know, you're driving at 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel. Take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and you're driving, and you see all this loose material that's heavy. And it was made many years ago, so it's heavy. Today, it's light. It used to be better. The problem is, you got to hold it up. And I say to myself -- every time I drive through, I say, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they are driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel, and the tile falls off. And there are so many missing tiles and such loose concrete. So we have to fix our infrastructure. It's not like we have a choice. We have no choice, and we're going to do it, and it also happens to mean jobs, which is a good thing.
We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and get states the flexibility that they need to make the end result really, really good for them. A very complicated issue. We have Tom Price, just got confirmed -- sitting here. [Applause] Stand up, Tom. And I spent a lot of time with Governor Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other day -- we were talking about it. They're really very expert on the subject, and I want to thank them. They spent a lot of time with me. Governor Christie who's here someplace. Where's Chris? Governor Christie, thank you. And so we have a lot of talent and a lot of expertise here, I will tell you. And we have come up with a solution that's really, really, I think, very good.
Now, I have to tell you, it's an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated. And statutorily and for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do healthcare before we do the tax cut. The tax cut is going to be major, it's going to be simple, and the whole tax plan is wonderful. But I can't do it until we do healthcare because we have to know what the healthcare is going to cost. And, statutorily, that's the way it is. So for those people that say, oh, gee, I wish we could do the tax first -- it just doesn't work that way. I would like to do that first. It's actually -- tax cutting has never been that easy, but it's a tiny, little ant compared to what we're talking about with Obamacare.
And you have to remember -- and I say this to Democrats in the room -- of which we have many -- Obamacare has failed. If you go to Minnesota, where they had a 66-percent increase, and the governor of Minnesota, who is with us today, said, Obamacare -- the Affordable Care Act -- is no longer affordable -- something to that effect. I think that might be it exactly. But the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare has failed.
I say to the Republicans, if you really want to do politically something good, don't do anything. Sit back for a period of two years, because '17 is going to be a disaster -- a disaster -- for Obamacare if we don't do something. Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room, and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama. Let it implode, and then let it implode in '18 even worse. Don't do anything, and they will come begging for us to do something. But that's not the fair thing to do for the people. It's not the fair thing.
Politically, I think it would be a great solution, because as soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing -- just a tiny, little change -- what's going to happen? They're going to say, it's the Republicans' problem. That's the way it is. But we have to do what's right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.
And it's interesting, it's sort of like, when you see -- you see it with politicians, you see it with President Obama -- when you know he's getting out of office and the clock is ticking, and he's not going to be there, his approval rating goes way up, even though, you know, not that active in the last period of time. The approval rating goes up. That's not him; that's like almost everybody. I see it happening with Obamacare. People hate it, but now they see that the end is coming, and they're saying, oh, maybe we love it. There's nothing to love. It's a disaster, folks, okay? So you have to remember that.
And, very importantly, we are going to work to restore local control to our nation's education system. Betsy is here someplace, and she is going to be, I think, fantastic. [Applause] I think she's going to be fantastic. Stand up, Betsy. Betsy feels so strongly, and she has had such support from so many people. You know, you don't see that too much because you see the anti, you never see the positive. But I can tell you, I've had so many calls while she was going through that horrible process. That was a tough, tough, nasty process. And she hung in, she was as strong as you get. But so many people were calling Betsy, saying you will do such a fantastic job once you get it.
It's like sometimes I'd say, it's much tougher to get into Harvard than it is to stay there. Does that make sense? It's tougher to get into the Wharton School of Finance -- you can't get in. But if you get in, it's fine, you get through, right? I think you're going to do a fantastic job, and we're very proud of you. And you took a lot of heat, but you're going to do great. So she wants to bring decision-making powers back to parents, back to the families and back to the states, where they can really control education.
And just finally, I'm looking forward to working with you on these projects and so much more. We're going to do these projects and so many more. And I thank you all again for being here. It's going to be a really productive discussion -- so productive that I'm going to ask the press to start leaving because I wouldn't want them to see any great, productive session. [Laughter] But they'll be seeing it and hearing about it.
Again, thank you very much all for being at the White House. We'll do this many times. I want the opinions of the governors of the states of the United States. So I want to just thank you all for being here, and let's take some questions, okay? [Applause] Thank you."
2017-02-24,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC ","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-february-24-2017,"My fellow Americans, as Black History Month 2017 comes to a close, I am very grateful for the many wonderful opportunities to honor African American heroes, faith leaders, entrepreneurs and the many others who changed the course of our Nation. We are blessed by the lives and examples of those who have made this Nation a beacon of freedom, talent, and unbreakable American spirit.
This week, I had the privilege of visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture right here in Washington, D.C. Itâs a new, beautiful Smithsonian museum that serves as a shining example of African Americansâ incredible contributions to our culture, our society, and our history. It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination.
The work and love of the people who helped create such a masterpiece is a testament to the legacy of so many leaders it honors. I left that museum confident that together, America can overcome any challenge.
Thereâs a great quote by Muhammad Ali in the museum -- âI shook up the world,â he said. And that is what he did. So did leaders like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, and so many others. They shook up the world for the better because they inspired our Nation to march toward justice and freedom for all. Today, and every day, I pledge to continue that march so that every American -- no matter his background, no matter her background -- has the chance to climb that great ladder of success.
It was very special to accompany Dr. Ben Carson and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. I am proud that soon he will serve in my cabinet as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a very, very powerful meaning far beyond housing. It is about transforming our communities. About bringing back hope. And Ben will do a fantastic job.
Thatâs what I am committed to doing also. I want every African-American child, family, and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities, and good-paying jobs. I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school -- so important. I also want to honor and promote the achievements of Historically Black Colleges and Universities throughout our Nation. They do a fantastic job. They are not given the credit that they deserve, and they are going to start getting that credit.
In order to help African Americans thrive, we are working very hard to make sure every child can grow up in a safe community -- and have access to high-paying jobs.
Weâve lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries -- and this has hurt the African American community very badly. This week I met with manufacturing CEOs -- weâre going to be working to bring back those jobs, and I mean really good-paying jobs.
I will be talking more about these issues in my Joint Session Address to Congress and to all Americans next Tuesday evening. I hope you will be watching. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America."
2017-02-24,"Speech: Donald Trump at CPAC - Oxon Hill, MD ","Oxon Hill, MD, United States","[-76.98972780000001, 38.80331779999999]",donald-trump-speech-cpac-oxon-hill-md-february-24-2017,"Thank you, everybody. So great to be with you. Thank you. [Applause] Great to be back at CPAC. It's a place I have really... I love this place. [Applause] Love you people. So thank you â thank you very much.
First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife, and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters and so great. When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance.
So I want to thank Matt and Mercedes. [Applause] And when Matt called and asked I said, ""Absolutely I'll be there with you."" I mean, the real reason I said it, I didn't want him to go against me cause that... [Laughter] ... that one you can't beat.
So I said absolutely. And it really is an honor to be here. I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends. [Applause] And we'll see you again next year and the year after that and I'll be doing this... [Applause] ... I'll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can and I'll make sure that we're here a lot. You know if you remember my first major speech â sit down everybody. C'mon. [Laughter]
You know the dishonest media they'll say, ""He didn't get a standing ovation."" You know why? [Laughter] No â you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they will say, ""He never got a standing ovation,"" right? [Inaudible]
They are the worst. [Applause, Chanting ""USA""] So â sit down. [Laughter] ""Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation."" [Laughter] They leave out the part, ""They never sat down."" They leave that out.
So I just want to thank â but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and â probably five or six years ago. First major political speech. And you were there. And it was â I loved it. I loved the people. I loved the commotion.
And then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn't even running, right? [Laughter] But it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country. And I said, ""Let's go to it.""
So, it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. I'll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, ""I think I like this business.""
Read More: President Trump Just Boasted About Winning Polls at CPAC. He Lost 6 Times [Laughter] I would've come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial. We wanted border security. We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we're going to get... [Applause]
... and people consider that controversial but you didn't consider it controversial. [Applause] So, I've been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years we've been together. And now you finally have a president, finally. Took you a long time. [Applause]
Took you a long time. [Applause] And it's patriots like you that made it happen, believe me. Believe me. You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make America great again. [Applause]
The media didn't think we would win. The... [Laughter]... pundits â you're right. They had an idea. The pundits didn't think we'd win. The consultants that suck up all that money â oh, they suck it up. They're so good. [Laughter]
They're not good at politics, but they're really good at sucking up people's money. Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.
But the consultants didn't think we would win. But they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them... [Applause]
... totally wrong. Never â and â and this is so true. And this is what's been happening. Never underestimate the people. Never. [Applause] I don't think it'll ever happen again.
And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake, phony, fake. [Applause] A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people. [Applause]
Because they have no sources, they just make 'em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, ""Nine people have confirmed."" There're no nine people. I don't believe there was one or two people. Nine people.
And I said, ""Give me a break."" Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people. But they say ""nine people."" And somebody reads it and they think, ""Oh, nine people. They have nine sources."" They make up sources.
They're very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word ""fake."" And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.
They take the word ""fake"" out. And now I'm saying, ""Oh no, this is no good."" But that's the way they are. So I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press. I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them.
And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don't go... [Laughter] I don't get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.
They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. [Applause]
A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being. Let 'em say it to my face. [Applause] Let there be no more sources. And remember this â and in not â in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story.
There are some great reporters around. They're talented, they're honest as the day is long. They're great. But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people.
And they shouldn't use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before. So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story â and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you're not part of the story. And if you're not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know â if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.
So when they make it up â and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls. The polls. They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.
Actually, a couple polls got it right. I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job. [Applause]
And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out. And I say, what network is it? And they'll say, a certain â let's not even mention names, right? Shall we? [Applause]
Well, you have a lot of them. Look, the Clinton News Network is one. [Applause] Totally. Take a look. Honestly. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at polls over the last two years. Now you'd think they would fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered, but I â who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they're not legit, but it's one or the other, look at how inaccurate â look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls. They're so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.
It creates like this narrative that is just like we're not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win, so I won't go and vote. I won't go and vote. It creates a whole false deal. And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it. They're very smart, they're very cunning and they're very dishonest.
So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment. [Laughter]
And I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me. Nobody. [Applause] I mean, who use its more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us â it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly. [Applause]
And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth. Doesn't tell the truth.
So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it doesn't tell the never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. [Applause]
I'm here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory... [Applause]
... was a victory and the win for conservative values. [Applause] And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag. [Applause]
Yeah, there we should stand up. Come on. There we should stand up. OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here â this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won't read about it, OK. [Laughter]
But there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day. [Applause]
And you're going to see it more and more. [Applause] So we're all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. There's never been anything like this. There's been some movements, but there's never been anything like this.
There's been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out. [Laughter] But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen? Not that I'm a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why? Because he's right on one issue; trade. He was right about trade. Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support. So actually, I like Bernie. OK? I like Bernie. [Applause]
But I'm here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America. First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first. [Applause, Chanting ""USA""]
For too long, we've traded away our jobs to other countries. So terrible. We've defended other nations' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in. We're going to build a wall, don't worry about it. We're building the wall. We're building the wall. In fact, it's going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule. [Applause] Way, way, way ahead of schedule. It's going to start very soon. General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job he's done. [Applause]
And remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. We're getting the bad ones out, OK? We're getting the bad â if you watch these people, it's like gee, that's so sad. We're getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn't be whether it's drugs or murder or other things. We're getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one. Basically all I've done is keep my promise. [Applause]
We've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East, we've spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it. [Booing]
And by the way, the Middle East is in â I mean, it's not even close, it's in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you. [Applause]
Be a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. This is the situation that I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me. We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. Now, I've been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn't work, folks. I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn't work.
And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you're watching, they're not you. They're largely â many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election. It's like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election. But I always say, Obamacare doesn't work. And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.
And the bottom line, we're changing it. We're going to make it much better, we're going to make it less expensive. We're going to make it much better.
Obamacare covers very few people â and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them â it was taken away from them. [Applause]
Millions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie, 28 times. You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan. Over and over and over again, you heard it. So we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. [Applause]
And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we're working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy. [Applause] But I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely, it's already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, it's a disaster. But two years, don't do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they'll beg and it's their problem. But it's not the right thing to do for the American people, it's not the right thing to do. [Applause]
We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it's doubled. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We don't win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Did we win anything? Do we win anything? We're going to win. We're going on win big, folks. We're going to start winning again, believe me. We're gonna win. [Chanting ""USA""]
But we're taking a firm, bold and decisive measure, we have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over, it's over. [Applause] Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that we're taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again. We've taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall. [Applause]
By doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this â our border patrol, I'll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to. [Laughter]
But they were disgusted with what they saw and we'll stop it. We'll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. Pouring in. Pouring in. [Applause]
We get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems, they get the cash. No good. No good. Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax â the dollars we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities. [Applause]
We are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country. [Applause]
And we will not let them back in. They're not coming back in, folks. They do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of. [Applause]
I'm also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed. Seven people, seven people, Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
Thank you, and thank them. I've also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [Applause]
So that we can protect our economic freedom. And we're going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they'll come back and we'll make a better deal. None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.
Just take a look â by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development. It's economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.
We're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines. [Applause]
And issued a new rule â this took place while I was getting ready to sign. I said who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful? I said nope, comes from the United States, or we're not building it. [Applause]
American steel. [Applause] If they want a pipeline in the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made in the United States. Do we agree? [Applause]
But can you imagine â I told this story the other day â can you imagine the gentleman â never met him, don't even know the name of this company. I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice. They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.
But with the Keystone â so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants â you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don't worry, I've used them all my life, OK? Don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry. Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it, right? Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there â a lot of jobs. Didn't sign it.
But can you imagine, he gave up. A year ago, it was dead, now he's doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved. [Applause]
Now, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they're now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right? Because that's the way the system works, a little bit off, but that's the way the system works.
We're preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas and beautiful clean coal and we're going to put our miners back to work. [Applause]
Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work. We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing. [Applause]
And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can't hire. We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. [Applause]
And by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don't need.
But we're going to have regulation. It's going to be really strong and really good and we're going to protect our environment and we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, OK? [Applause]
Another major promise is tax reform. We're going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. [Applause]
In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country, you see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-president, they say president- elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time. [Laughter]
Because Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they're going back to Michigan and they're going back to Ohio and they're going back to Pennsylvania and they're going back to North Carolina and to Florida. [Applause]
It's time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work, you're going to love it, you're going to love it, you're going to love it. [Applause]
We're also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military. [Applause] And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we'll never have to use it, but nobody's gonna mess with us, folks, nobody. [Applause]
It will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history. No one will dare question as they have been because we're very depleted, very, very depleted. Sequester. Sequester. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength and that's what we will have. [Applause]
As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS. [Applause]
Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. [Applause] At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security; foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. [Applause]
By the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. [Laughter]
And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what's going on? And it turned out that they didn't â not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden. But they understand. The people over there understand I'm right. Take a look at what's happening in Sweden. Take a look at what's happening in Germany. Take a look at what's happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris.
I have a friend, he's a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn't seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how's Paris doing? ""Paris? I don't go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris."" That was four years â four or five years hasn't gone there. He wouldn't miss it for anything. Now he doesn't even think in terms of going there.
Take a look at what's happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can't let it happen to us. [Applause] So let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [Applause] We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand-new action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action. I will never ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people, I won't do it. [Applause]
If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it's OK, doesn't bother me. The security of our people is number one, is number one. [Applause]
Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don't have my Cabinet approved, nobody mentions that. [Booing] You know, I still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they're gonna be approved. It's just a delay, delay, delay, it's really sad, it's really sad. And these are great people, these are some great people. We still don't have our Cabinet. I assume we're setting records for that. That's the only thing good about it is we're setting records. I love setting records. [Applause]
But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, Democrats, please approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you don't mind. [Applause, Laughter]
But we're taking meetings everyday with top leaders in business, in science and industry. Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office; Caterpillar, Tractor, Campbell's Soup. We had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell's Soup. [Applause, Laughter]
We had everybody and we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of those folks that are in that room are gonna be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs. And you know what? They're gonna be building them in this country, not in some other country. [Applause]
We're meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we're meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed. They were closed, folks. You don't realize that, they were closed.
They're now wide open and they're open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. [Applause] And when they come into the White House, we're translating these meetings into action. One by one, we're checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one, a lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag. [Applause]
We will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. We're taking care of our veterans. [Applause] We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good. None of them. You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. Where did they come from? Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest. They're not as stupid as you think. [Laughter]
We will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. So true. [Applause]
And by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment. [Applause] You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA and they didn't have that on the list. It's lucky I thought about it. [Laughter]
But we will indeed, and they're great people. And by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country. [Applause]
The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote, and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from? What's going on here? These are hard-working, great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They're not deplorable. [Booing, Chanting ""Lock Her Up""]
Who would have thought that a word was gonna play so badly? [Laughter] That's the problem in politics. One wrong word and it's over. She also said irredeemable, but we won't mention that. [Laughter]
The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker. [Applause] You know, we haven't been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running in the primaries. Millions and millions of people were joining. Now, I won't say it was because of me, but it was. OK? [Applause, Laughter]
And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it and it's gonna see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me, a lot sooner than you think. [Applause]
We will not answer to donors or lobbyists, or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me. [Applause]
Global cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good, it's very important. But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I'm representing. [Applause]
I'm not representing the globe, I'm representing your country. [Applause, Chanting ""USA""] There's one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America, it's the allegiance to America. [Applause]
No matter our background or income, or geography, we're all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color or the blood â the color of the blood we bleed, it's the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember, great patriots. [Applause]
We all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal â totally equal in the eyes of almighty God, we're equal. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause]
And I want to thank, by the way, the Evangelical community, the Christian community. [Applause] Communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers, because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentage of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks, that was amazing â an amazing outpour... [Applause]
... and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great, we are Americans and the future belongs to us. [Applause]
The future belongs to all of you. And America is coming about, and it's coming back, and it's roaring and you can hear it. It's going to be bigger and better. It is going to be â it is going to be â remember and it's roaring. It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [Applause]
I want to thank you. And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have. I see them; they're all over the place. You are really great people. I want to thank you. [Applause] And I want to say to you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, folks. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-02-18,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Political Rally in Melbourne, Florida","Melbourne, FL, United States","[-80.60810889999999, 28.0836269]",donald-trump-speech-melbourne-fl-february-18-2017,"Thank you. Let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Good afternoon. It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States. The midâ the America we envision is one that works for all Americans, and where all Americans can work and succeed. A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide. I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me.
I will act in the best interest of all of you. I am committed to creating and supporting initiatives geared to my heart, which will have impacts on women and children all around the world.
My husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
Thank you, everybody, thank you. I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.
It's so great to be here in Florida. My second home with you. This is a state I truly love. This is a state where we all had great victory together. Thank you.
It's now been a month since my inauguration. And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again. I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.
I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else. This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you. I promise you that. I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.
I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it.
They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, ânothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.â âTruth itself,â he said, âbecomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,â that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.
We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.
We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.
We will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from.
The fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.
It will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.
You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work.
You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.
You want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the [inaudible] of our politicians. It's not going to happen any longer.
You want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, âMade in the USA.â You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore.
We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave.
And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises.
A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country. And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs. They're going to start highs. It's going to be a new day in America. You're going to be proud again.
Jobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.
I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others.
My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it.
Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.
We believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.
And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually â a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane.
So think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully.
In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?
But we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people.
Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies.
And what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be â they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing.
We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay.
Let him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to â come on up. Come here.
This guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.
I did sir.
Say a couple of words to this crowd.
Mr. President, thank you sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today. When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us. Thank you so much, sir.
A star is born.
A star is born. That's fine.
I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.
All the way outside of this â this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.
I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us.
We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again.
I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.
And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a â yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear.
I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.
I was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong.
They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: âWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United Statesâ â okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.
âIf it would be detrimental to the interest of the United Statesâ â okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.
âHe may,â so the President may, âby proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessaryâ â now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?
So and it goes, âfor such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.â So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.
We had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league â and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.
Here's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.
And we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else â folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.
We do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.
I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now â you know, he said it, he said it â and now Secretary âMad Dogâ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.
And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.
We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats â no wonder they're doing so badly.
No wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.
My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.
Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will.
We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.
You're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.
The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away.
The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me.
And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before.
May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."
2017-02-17,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC ","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-february-17-2017,"My fellow Americans, we have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work.
I've been saying I was going to do that for a long time. This week, I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continue to keep my promises to the American people, and so much more.
I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats. Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around, and we're going to turn it around quickly.
We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans, as part of the deal. That's why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies.
By stopping this regulation, we were able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job killing compliance costs.
But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White House's ""Women's Business Leaders Roundtable."" Very exciting, great women. As President, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets, and networks of support that they need -- and I mean, really need. And it's going to happen.
This is a priority for my administration. I campaigned on helping women in the workforce, and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me.
In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting.
The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond, this week, with our cherished ally, Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House.
I affirmed to the Prime Minister America's commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability.
The threat of terrorism -- and believe me, it is a threat, must be confronted and defeated. And we will defeat it.
We share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life.
So, as you head into President's Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf. We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants, or pundits. We are here to work for you, and only for you, the American people.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2017-02-17,"Speech: Donald Trump at Boeing Plant, North Charleston, South Carolina","North Charleston, SC, United States","[-80.0130514, 32.8771106]",donald-trump-speech-north-charleston-sc-february-17-2017,"Thank you, Dennis. And I have to say, I love South Carolina. I love it. [Applause]
Remember we came down -- all together, we came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide. This was a good one. [Applause] So I want to thank the people of South Carolina and your governor -- tremendous guy. He supported us right from the beginning. So I'd like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job. He's right here someplace. Thank you very much. You have been fantastic.
And I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane. [Applause] Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it. What an amazing piece of art. What an amazing piece of work.
Thank you, Dennis, for the invitation to be with you today. You know, in the old days, when I made this speech I got paid a lot of money. Now I have to do it for nothing. [Laughter, applause] Not a good deal, but that's okay. We love it.
It's wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor. Where is Henry? He's around here someplace. Where is he? Stand up, Henry. Proud of you. He helped us so much. [Applause]
And I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who is doing an awfully good job for us. [Applause] She's representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations. She is doing a spectacular job. It's early, but she has just been really great.
We're here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing. We're also here today to celebrate jobs. Jobs. [Applause] This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina. Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made right here in the U.S.A. [Applause]
It's amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door, in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane. The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth. It was so small that Orville's brother, Wilbur, could not join him on the flight. He was always very upset about that. The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible.
That flight was a testament to the American spirit. I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country. I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign. We have the greatest people anywhere in the world. We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what's going on today in our country -- you look at what's happening with jobs. You look at what's happening with plants moving back into our country. All of a sudden, they're coming back. And they're going to be very happy about it, believe me. [Applause] They're going to be very, very happy. [Applause]
As your President, I am going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work. [Applause] This is our mantra: Buy American and Hire American. [Applause]
We want products made in America, made by American hands. You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota. And I'm getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that's good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. [Applause] And you know what? That's the way it is. It's the way it's going to be.
We are going to fight for every last American job. We've come a long way since the Wright Brothers and their first flight more than a century ago. Your plane is made of carbon fiber. It seats 330 passengers. It's 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787. And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground. The name says it all: Dreamliner. Great name. Our country is all about making dreams come true.
Over the last number of years, that hasn't been necessarily the case, but we're going to make it the case again. [Applause]
That's what we do in America -- we dream of things, and then we build them. We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that, believe me, in the months and years to come. [Applause]
I also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd. [Applause]
South Carolina has a long, very, very, proud military tradition and history. We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all the men and women who wear the uniform. [Applause]
We are going to fully rebuild our military -- by the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets? [Applause] Or do you only care about -- what do you think? Well -- [jet flies overhead] -- thought that was a Super Hornet. [Laughter] We are looking seriously at a big order, and we'll see how that -- you know the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator. [Laughter] But I think we may get there.
We're also working on the Air Force One project, which was a difficult project for previous administrations. But it looks like we're getting closer and closer. [Applause]
And we're going to ensure that our great servicemembers have the tools, equipment, training and resources they need to get the job done. [Applause] As George Washington said, being prepared for war is the best way to prevent it. And that's really what it is: The best way to prevent war, being prepared. Peace through strength. We build a military might so great -- and we are going to do that -- that none will dare to challenge it. None. [Applause]
We will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal. Right now it's not that way. It will be that way very, very soon. Believe me. You will be an important player in this effort.
Boeing has built many important aircraft -- including, as I said, the F-18 Super Hornet, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few. [Applause]
And I'm being very, very serious -- the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old. Can you believe it? What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane. [Laughter] I don't know. Which one do we like better folks? Tell me. [Applause]
On every front, we are going to work for the American people. Nowhere in our focus -- and I mean this so strongly -- and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs. And jobs is one of the primary reasons I'm standing here today as your President, and I will never, ever disappoint you. Believe me. I will not disappoint you. [Applause]
I campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America. We wanted to make much easier -- it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave. I don't want companies leaving our country, making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country. We're not letting that happen anymore, folks. Believe me. There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product, and think that they're going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border. Going to be a lot different. It's going to be a lot different. [Applause]
Already American Industry will come roaring back. And believe me if we -- not me, I'm a messenger -- if we didn't have this victory, we wouldn't be even talking about it. To achieve that goal, we're going to massively reduce job-crushing regulations -- already started; you've seen that -- that send our jobs to those other countries. We are going to lower taxes on American business so it's cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America. [Applause]
We are going to enforce -- very strongly enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating. Tremendous cheating. Tremendous cheating. We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words: Made in the USA. [Applause, Audience Chants USA]
Since November, jobs have already begun to surge. We're seeing companies open up factories in America. We're seeing them keep jobs at home. Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler -- just to name a very, very few. So many more already. They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back in country because the business climate, they know, has already changed.
In Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10,000 American jobs. They are spending billions of dollars. [Applause]
We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes -- including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for business -- and creating a level playing field for our workers. When there is a level playing field, and I've been saying this for a long time, American workers will always, always, always win. But we don't have a level playing field. Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again. [Applause] Because when American workers win, America as a country wins -- big league wins.
That's my message here today. America is going to start winning again -- winning like never, ever before. We are not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form. We love America, and we are going to protect America. We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers. We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better-paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country. Believe me. [Applause]
You've heard me say it before, and I will say it again: From now on, it's going to be America first. [Applause] Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish -- no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach. Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me -- both of them, when you think about it -- we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves. And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer. The election took care of that. [Applause]
And we will pass on to our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright. Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free. And each of you will be part of creating that new American future.
I want to thank you, South Carolina. I want to thank the great people of South Carolina. God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing. [Applause]
Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
2017-02-11,"Weekly Address: Donald Trump - Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-february-11-2017,"My fellow Americans, this week, our hearts are with the people of Louisiana and Mississippi. Families have lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods after a devastating tornado swept through many, many communities. My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We're going to take care of them.
It's remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit. There's nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country, and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild American to, as I have said so often, make America great again.
On Tuesday, I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona, creating thousands of new American jobs. That's what we want, new American jobs and good jobs. Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies.
In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses. We want to make it much easier to do business in America, and that's what we're going to do. We're going to make it also much harder for companies to leave. They're not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences.
I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world, but we can't do that if we don't stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete. Every hour of every day, my administration is focused on creating jobs for our people, and I mean good jobs. More jobs, better jobs, higher paying jobs, that's our mission.
This week, I also met with sheriffs and police chiefs from across the country. I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement and so too will our great new attorney general, Jeff Sessions. My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists, radical and dangerous extremists from ever entering our country.
We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow. We will defend our country, protect our Constitution and deliver real prosperity for our people.
God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week."
2017-02-08,Speech: Donald Trump - MCCA Speech,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-february-8-2017,"Thank you very much. This is -- great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with. Please sit down. They'll say I didn't get a standing ovation because they never sat down. [Laughter] And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down.
But I want to thank you. I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it. And when I'm with the police chiefs and I'm with the sheriffs of our country -- and these are the big ones. These are the really big ones. I just want to thank you very much. And I thought before I spoke about what we're really here to speak about, I would read something to you. Because you can be a lawyer, or you don't have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this.
And it's really incredible to me that we have a court case that's going on so long. As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now we're in an era that, let's just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room. I'd like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.
But I'm going to read what's in dispute, what's in question. And you will see this -- it's INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f): ""Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President"" -- okay, now, this isn't just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President. And this was done, very importantly, for security -- something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren't going to do us harm.
And that's why it was done. And it couldn't have been written any more precisely. It's not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully. So just listen, here's what it says. This is what they're arguing:
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens -- okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens -- ""or of any class of aliens"" -- so any aliens, any class of aliens -- ""into the United States"" -- so the entry of people into the United States. Let's say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States.
So any time -- ""whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States"" -- right? So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States -- and certainly there's lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn't even have them, necessarily -- he may be -- and ""he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessaryâ¦"" Now, the only mistake is they should have said ""he or she."" But hopefully, it won't be a she for at least another seven years. After that, I'm all -- [Applause, Laughter] See? I just noticed that, actually. I just noticed it. I'm saying, whoa, this is not politically correct. It's correct, but it's not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.
He may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary -- so here it is, people coming in -- suspend the entry of all aliens. Right? That's what it says. It's not like -- again, a bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this. Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens. Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right? You can suspend the aliens from coming in -- very strong -- or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
Okay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country -- which, again, you're the chiefs, you're the sheriffs. You understand this.
And I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges, and I'll comment on that -- I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge. But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they'd what they should be doing. I mean, it's so sad.
They should be -- when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written -- other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she -- but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched -- I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn't believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.
And I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won't call it biased. And we haven't had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.
Right now, we are at risk because of what happened. General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man -- now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security. We are doing our job. He's a great man. [Applause] We're doing our job. And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly -- in fact, I said, let's give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement -- and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it. We knew about everything. We do things well. We did things right.
But the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you can't give a notice, because if you give a notice that you're going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now -- I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week? They said, no, you can't do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on. Do you people agree? I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement. [Applause]
So I wanted to give, like, a month. Then I said, well, what about a week? They said, well, then you're going to have a whole pile of people perhaps -- perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions.
So there it is, folks. It's as plain as you can have it. I didn't -- and I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful. It was disgraceful. Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just can't be written any plainer or better. And for us to be going through this -- and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor. You heard that.
In fact, I said to my people, why don't you use the Boston case? And there were reasons why they couldn't use the Boston case. This one came later for various reasons. But use the Boston case. And I won't read that, but there were statements made by that judge -- who, again, highly respected -- that were right on. They were perfect. They were perfect.
So I think it's sad. I think it's a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country. As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security.
One of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security. It's one of the reasons I was elected. Also jobs and lots of other things. But I think one of the strongest reasons is security. And they're taking away our weapons one by one, that's what they're doing. And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time. And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls -- assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them weren't. I really believe that. [Applause]
But we need security in our country. We have to allow you folks to do your job. You're great people, great people. Great men and women. And we have to allow you to do your job. And we have to give you the weapons that you need. And this is a weapon that you need. And they're trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views. We can't let that happen.
So with that, let's get on to business, right? It's really something. Thank you. [Applause]
I want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service. You have had great service. Everyone has told me about you two legendary people. All of us here today are united by one shared mission: to serve and protect the public of the United States.
During my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country. They are the most incredible people you will ever meet. And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause]
There are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities. But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership. Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day. And they're entitled to an administration that has their back. [Applause]
The first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws. And I'm going to add justices, judges in that category. And I'm very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court -- outstanding. [Applause]
So I'd like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States. My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House. You have. [Applause] I stand with you. I support our police. I support our sheriffs. And we support the men and women of law enforcement. [Applause]
Right now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis. Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits. In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher. What is going on in Chicago?
We cannot allow this to continue. We've allowed too many young lives to be claimed -- and you see that, you see that all over -- claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear. Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American. This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action. This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.
Whether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born. Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.
So many lives and so many people have been cut short. Their potential, their life has been cut short. So much potential has been sidelined. And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken. It's time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. And, by the way, we will do that. And I will say this: General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall. And it will be a real wall. [Applause] And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me. The wall is getting designed right now. A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall. I wasn't kidding. I don't kid. I don't kid. I watch this, and they say I was kidding. No, I don't kid. I don't kid about things like that, I can tell you. No, we will have a wall. It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of -- will be a big help. Just ask Israel about walls. Do walls work? Just ask Israel. They work -- if it's properly done.
It's time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and it's time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support. You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done. We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands. That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement. [Applause] We all see what happens. We all see what happens and what's been happening to you. It's not fair.
We must protect those who protect us. The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before. Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution â- think of this. Who ever heard of this? They were targeted for execution. Twelve were shot and five were killed. These heroic officers died as they lived -â protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save. Hats off to you people.
These slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public. We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.
God has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us. Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours. You work long hours. I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what you're doing. They do it because they care.
We must work with them, not against them. They're working against you. For many years they've been working against you. We must support them, not undermine them. And instead of division and disunity -- and which is so much disunity -- we must build bridges of partnership and of trust. Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help. When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most. And I see it all the time. When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.
To build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other. We must listen to each other. All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct -- so important.
You're the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom -- they have great respect for you. Tremendous respect. You don't even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent. And don't let anyone ever tell you different. Don't let the dishonest media try and convince you that it's different than that, because it's not. [Applause]
That is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent. As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis. Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment. We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before -- ever. [Applause]
I've been here two weeks. I've met a lot of law enforcement officials. Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office. I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime? They said, 75 to 80 percent. That's pretty sad. We're going to stop the drugs from pouring in. We're going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people. We're going to be ruthless in that fight. We have no choice. [Applause]
And we're going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence. You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly -- now Secretary Kelly -- who the illegal immigrant gang members are. Now, you have that power because you know them, you're there, you're local. You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames. You have that power. The federal government can never be that precise. But you're in the neighborhoods -- you know the bad ones, you know the good ones.
I want you to turn in the bad ones. Call Secretary Kelly's representatives and we'll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we'll do it fast. You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems -- you look at Chicago and you look at other places. So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.
And we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with. Terrorism -- a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand. Believe me. I've learned a lot in the last two weeks. And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand. But we're going to take care of it. We're going to win. We're going to take care of it, folks.
Let today be the beginning of a great national partnership. Let today serve as a great call to action. And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities. I want you to know the American public totally stands with you. I want you to know the American people support you. I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you.
We applaud your efforts. We thank you for your service. And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House -- an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide. They're great people. You are great people.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"
2017-02-06,"Speech: Donald Trump - MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida","Tampa, FL, United States","[-82.4571776, 27.950575]",donald-trump-speech-tampa-fl-february-6-2017,"[Applause] Thank you very much. Thatâs so nice. A lot of spirit. Great spirit for this country. Thank you, all. We have tremendous spirit and I want to thank you.
We had a wonderful election, didnât we? [Applause] And I saw those numbers -- and you like me, and I like you. Thatâs the way it worked. [Laughter]
I'm honored to be here today among so many of our really and truly great heroes. I want to begin by thanking General Votel and General Thomas for their distinguished leadership and service on behalf of our country. Very, very outstanding people. Iâd also like to thank General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Thatâs big stuff, when you have the Chairman. Where is -- Joe, stand up for a second. This is one of the great people. [Applause] Thank you.
Also, Commander Vogel and everyone serving at MacDill Air Force Base. Quite a place. And weâre going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment. Youâve been lacking a little equipment.
Weâre going to load it up. Youâre going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me. [Applause]
So importantly, also, let me thank all of the coalition partners and their representatives assembled here today. We proudly -- very proudly -- stand with you, and we will be fighting for your security. Theyâre fighting for our security and freedom.
Let me recognize our great governor and a very good friend of mine, and somebody who endorsed me -- that makes him a better friend of mine. [Laughter] You know, if they donât endorse, believe me, if youâre ever in this position, itâs never quite the same, okay? [Laughter] You can talk, but it never means the same. But this man is a great, great governor and has done a fantastic job -- Rick Scott, governor, stand up please. [Applause] Thank you, Rick.
Finally, on behalf of the entire nation, let me express our gratitude to all members -- and I mean all members -- of our military serving in the United States Central Command and the United States Special Operations Command. We salute the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, along with our civilian defense personnel, who are so important to the success of what weâre doing.
Let me also recognize the military families and spouses who bravely shoulder the burdens of war. I want every military family in this country to know that our administration is at your service. We stand with you 100 percent. We will protect those who protect us, and we will never ever let you down.
As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the American people -- highest duty we have. I said it the other night. Great, great Supreme Court nominee -- you all saw that -- but I said to myself, perhaps the only thing more important to me definitely is the defense of our nation. The Supreme Court is so important, but we have to defend our nation. And we will do that, believe me. [Applause] We will do that. And each and every one of you is central to that mission.
The men and women serving at CENTCOM and SOCOM have poured out their hearts and souls for this country. They really experience things that very few people get to experience. Youâve shed your blood across the continents and the oceans. Youâve engaged the enemy on distant battlefields, toiled in the burning heat and bitter cold, and sacrificed everything so that we can remain safe and strong and free.
Our administration will always honor our sacred bond to those who serve, and we will never ever forget you. Believe me, we will never ever forget you.
We will ensure that the men and women of our military have the tools, equipment, resources, training, and supplies you need to get the job done. Youâve seen me say weâve been depleted. Our navy is at a point almost as low as World War I. Thatâs a long time ago.
Thatâs a long time ago. Itâs not going to happen anymore, folks. Itâs not going to happen anymore -- not with me.
But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that. And I want to thank Lockheed Martin and I want to thank Boeing, and I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up.
And when I say opened up, Rick Scott understands this very well -- opened up and cut their prices. Okay? Because thatâs what they did. And weâve got that program, itâs going to be back in really great shape from really being very troubled.
And we are going to be taking care of our great veterans. We will make a historic financial investment in the Armed Forces of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense of freedom. We have your back every hour, every day, now and always. That also means getting our allies to pay their fair share.
It's been very unfair to us. We strongly support NATO. We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions to the NATO Alliance, which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even close, and they have to do that.
Central Command and Central [Special] Operations Command are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism. America stands in awe of your courage. Those serving at CENTCOM have bravely fought across the theater of war in the Middle East, and bravely battled a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life. Today, we express our gratitude to everyone serving overseas, including all of our military personnel in Afghanistan.
SOCOM has dispatched its legendary warriors to the most secret, sensitive and daring missions in defense of the United States of America. No enemy stands a chance against our Special Forces -- not even a chance. They don't have a chance, and that's the way we're going to keep it.
And you're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man. Going to be better off.
For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the Earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large -- very, very large.
We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction -- you've seen that. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you've seen what happened in Paris and Nice.
All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.
So today, we deliver a message in one very unified voice: To these forces of death and destruction, America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We're not going to allow it.
You've been seeing what's been going on over the last few days. We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in -- not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country. [Applause]
Freedom, security and justice will prevail. In his first State of the Union message, President George Washington wrote that, To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."" Almost 200 years later
The men and women of the United States military provide the strength to bring peace to our troubled, troubled times. We stand behind you. We support your mission. We love our country.
We are loyal to our people. We respect our flag. We celebrate our traditions. We honor our heroes. You are our heroes. And we are prepared to fight. And we pray for peace.
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]"

A great man. Chief Owens gave his life for his country and for our people. Our debt to him and his family
My fellow Americans. This week I nominated Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch is one of the most qualified people ever to be nominated for this post. He is a graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford. He is a man of principle. He has an impeccable resume. He is widely respected by everyone. And, Judge Gorsuch's proven track record upholding the Constitution makes him the ideal person to fill the vacancy left by the late, great Antonin Scalia, a truly fabulous justice.
Ten years ago, the Senate unanimously approved Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge members of both parties to support Judge Gorsuch and, in so doing, to protect our laws and our freedoms.
This week we also took significant action to roll back the massive regulation that is devastating our economy and crippling American companies and jobs.
That's why I have issued a new executive order to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction. This order requires that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must-and I mean must-be eliminated. It's out of control.
The January employment report shows that the private sector added 237,000 jobs last month. A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has. Job growth far surpassed expectations in January, and the labor force participation also grew, so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy. It's going to be a whole new ball game.
But there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.
Also this week, on the first day of Black History Month, I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House. We are determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs and safety for the African-American citizens of our country. America can really never, ever rest until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream-so important. I think, probably, one of my most and maybe my most important goal. It is our mutual duty and obligation to make sure this happens.
God has truly blessed this nation to have given us such a brave and selfless patriot as Ryan. We will never forget him. We will never ever forget those who serve. Believe me.
And I will never forget that my responsibility is to keep you-the American people-safe and free.
That's why last week I signed an executive order to help keep terrorists out of our country. The executive order establishes a process to develop new vetting and mechanisms to ensure those coming into America love and support our people. That they have good intentions.
On every single front, we are working to deliver for American workers and American families. You, the law-abiding citizens of this country, are my total priority. Your safety, your jobs and your wages guide our decisions.
We are here to serve you, the great and loyal citizens of the United States of America.
The forgotten men and women will be never be forgotten again. Because from now on, it's going to be America First. That's how I got elected, that's why you voted for me, and I will never forget it.
God Bless You, and God Bless America."
2017-01-31,Speech: Donald Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch ,"Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-january-31-2017,"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court. I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written.
This may be the most transparent judicial selection process in history. Months ago as a candidate, I publicly presented a list of brilliant and accomplished people to the American electorate and pledged to make my choice from among that list. Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them when they voted for me for president.
I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time. Today...
Thank you. Today I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court to be of the United States Supreme Court. And I would like to ask Judge Gorsuch and his wonderful wife, Louise, to please step forward â please, Louise, Judge. Here they come. Here they come. [Applause]
So was that a surprise? Was it? I have always felt that after the defense of our nation, the most important decision a president of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years and his or her decisions can last a century or more and can often be permanent.
I took the task of this nomination very seriously. I have selected an individual whose qualities define â really, and I mean closely define â what weâre looking for. Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support. When he was nominated to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, he was confirmed by the Senate unanimously. Also â thatâs unanimous, can you believe that? Nowadays, with whatâs going on? [Applause]
Does that happen anymore? Does it happen? I think itâs going to happen. Maybe it will. Also with us tonight is Maureen Scalia, a woman loved by her husband and deeply respected by all. I am so happy sheâs with us. Where is Maureen? Please, stand up. Thank you, Maureen. [Applause]
Thank you, Maureen. She is really the ultimate representative of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, whose image and genius was in my mind throughout the decision-making process. Not only are we looking at the writings of the nominee â and I studied them closely â but he is said to be among the finest and most brilliant oftentimes the writings of any judge for a long, long time.
And his academic credentials, something very important to me, in that education has always been a priority, are as good as I have ever seen. He received his undergraduate degree from Columbia with honors. He then received his law degree from Harvard, also with honors, where he was a Truman Scholar. After Harvard, he received his doctorate at Oxford, where he attended as a Marshall Scholar, one of the top academic honors anywhere in the world.
After law school, he clerked on the Supreme Court for both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. It is an extraordinary rÃ©sumÃ©. As good as it gets. Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado and was taught the value of independence, hard work and public service. While in law school, he demonstrated a commitment to helping the less fortunate. He worked in both Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Projects and Harvard Defenders Program. Brilliance being assured, I studied every aspect of his life. He could have had any job at any law firm for any amount of money, but what he wanted to do with his career was to be a judge, to write decisions and to make an impact by upholding our laws and our Constitution.
The qualifications of Judge Gorsuch are beyond dispute. He is the man of our country and a man who our country really needs and needs badly to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice.
I would like to thank Senate leadership. I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once for the good of the country. Congratulations to you and your family. May God bless you, may God bless our glorious nation. Judge Gorsuch, the podium, sir, is yours. [Applause]"

One week ago, our administration assumed the enormous responsibilities that you, the American people have placed in us. There is much work to do in the days ahead. But I wanted to give you an update on what we have accomplished already.
In my first few days as your president, I've met with the leaders of some of our nation's top manufacturing companies and labor unions. My message was clear: we want to make things in America, and we want to use American workers. Since my election, many companies have announced they are no longer moving jobs out of our country, but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.
Every day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American people. Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days.
An order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare. It's about time. The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect American workers. That would have been a disastrous deal for our workers.
An order to begin construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines following a renegotiation of terms with the requirement that pipelines installed in America be built with American steel and manufactured here.
A directive to expedite permits for new infrastructure and new manufacturing plants. An order to immediately begin the border wall and to crack down on sanctuary cities. They are not safe. We have to take care of that horrible situation.
This administration has hit the ground running at a record pace. Everybody's talking about it. We're doing it with speed, and we're doing it with intelligence and we will never, ever stop fighting on behalf of the American people. God bless you, and God bless America."

Secretary Mattis devoted his life to serving his country. He's a man of honor, a man of devotion, and a man of total action.
He likes action. He is the right man at the right time and he will do us all very very proud.
I'm honored to stand here today among so many Patriots. You are the backbone of this country.
You are the spirit of this nation in every sense. The men and women of the United States military, are the greatest force for justice and peace and goodness that have ever walked the face of this Earth.
Your legacy exists everywhere in the world today where people are more free, more prosperous and more secure because of the United States of America, and you have earned and insured for our children the glorious birthright of freedom bestowed upon us by God. We stand today at the Hall of Heroes.
Great, here's a testament to the undying courage of those who wear our nation's uniform and have received the highest distinction, the Medal of Honor. This is a sacred hall.
The soul of our nation lives between these walls. These walls tell the story of those intrepid Americans who gave everything, risked everything and fought with everything They had to save their fellow warriors and warriors they are.
Believe me, warriors they are and to save, our wondrous liberties and to save this God-blessed land, they shed their blood and poured out the love from their hearts to protect our home. We are in awe of their valor, tremendous valor and we pledge our dedication to every single family serving our country and our flag.
That is why today I'm signing to executive actions to ensure the sacrifices of our military are supported by the actions of our government and they will always be supported by the actions of our government, believe me. First i'm signing an executive action to begin a great building of the armed services of the United States, developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform and I'm very proud to be doing this.
As we prepare a budget request for Congress, and I think Congress is going to be very happy to see it our military strength will be questioned by no one. But neither will our dedication to peace.
We do one peace. Secondly I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.
We don't want them here. We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.
We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people. We will never forget the lessons of 9/11 nor the heroes who lost their lives at the Pentagon.
They were the best of us. We will honor them not only with our words but with our actions, and that's what we're doing today.
I am privileged to be here with you and I promise that our administration will always have your back. We will always be with you and I just want to thank you.
I want to just extend a very special congratulations to a great man and thank Secretary -- and I think he's going to lead us so brilliantly. He's a tremendous soldier, always has been.
He's a General's General. Every general that I spoke to, they just I won't say that they all said he's our favorite but they did.
He's our favorite he's a special, special man. So I want to bless him and God bless you and God bless America and Secretary Mattis.
I have no doubt you're going to do an outstanding job. And thank you very much for accepting this responsibility. [Applause]"
2017-01-26,Speech: Donald Trump - Republican Retreat in Philadelphia,"Philadelphia, PA, United States","[-75.1652215, 39.9525839]",donald-trump-speech-philadelphia-pa-january-26-2017,"Thank you very much, Mitch. So nice. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. So nice. Nice to win. Do we agree? It's been a while. It's been a while since we had this position. Nice to win. [Applause] And I want to thank everybody in the room. So many friends. Thank you very much. [Applause] Sit down, everybody. Let's enjoy ourselves.
It's great to be in Philadelphia. I went to school in Philadelphia. This is a very special place in our nation's history. It's the place where we launched our American independence. The state of Pennsylvania is very special to me for lots of reasons, especially from a couple of months ago. Remember? [Applause]
Pennsylvania cannot be won. Remember? Pennsylvania cannot be won. Right, Congressman? There is no path to victory for Trump in Pennsylvania, except we won.
Now, it has been a long time since you guys did this, but it was just a great victory. It was a great evening. It was a great evening, I will tell you. But it sort of started in Pennsylvania.
They all said that Pennsylvania was the bride that got away; that it was the state that everybody from the Republican Party that ran in Pennsylvania for 38 years thought they won, except they never won. And I thought I won, too, but I was afraid to say it, Mitch, because it just seemed that it wasn't working out. So I just said, you know what, I think we did great; let's see what happens. But good things happened.
So we love this state and we will see it many times again.
Now is the dawn of a new era of American independence, a rededication to the idea that the people are in charge of their own destiny. I want to thank Majority Leader McConnell -- great guy; and Speaker Paul Ryan -- very, very special. And he is writing his heart out, right? And we're actually going to sign the stuff that you're writing. You're not wasting your time. [Applause]
He would write and he'd send it up, and nothing would happen. But now it's going to happen.
For their leadership and for inviting me here today, thank you very much.
And thank you, Leader McCarthy, Senator Cornyn, Congressman Scalise, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Congressman Messer, for your leadership as well. It's been terrific.
This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever, maybe ever. Think of that. And think of everything we can achieve. And remember who we must achieve it for. We're here now because tens of millions of Americans have placed their hopes in us to transfer power from Washington, D.C. and give it back to the people. [Applause]
So important. [Applause] Now we have to deliver. Enough all talk, no action. We have to deliver. This our chance to achieve great and lasting change for our beloved nation.
Since taking office, I have taken major contractual steps to restore the rule of law and to return power to everyday Americans. [Applause]
And even though it's only a few days, we've done it in record numbers. We've issued executive orders to build the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. [Applause] And issued a new requirement for American pipelines to be made with American steel and fabricated in the United States. [Applause]
And I was sitting at my desk and I'm getting ready to sign Keystone and Dakota, I said where's the pipe coming from -- and I won't tell you where, but you wouldn't be happy. I say, why is it we build pipelines and we're not using pipe that's made in our country. I say, let's put that little clause in, like it's a one sentence clause, but that clause is gonna attract a lot of people and we're gonna make that pipe right here in America. OK? [Applause]
If people want to build pipelines on our land, we want the pipe to be manufactured -- and not only that, manufactured here, but you will see a level of quality that you're not going to see when they bring pipe from far distances, have to bring it in small chunks and then fabricate it on the land. Give me a break. We can do much better than that and we're going to do it much better and it's gonna end up costing less money, believe me. We've reinstated the Mexico City policy, a long-standing policy... [Applause] Isn't that nice? [Applause]
And by the way, on Friday, a lot of people are gonna be showing up to Washington. Right, Mike? A lot of people. You know, the press never gives them the credit that they deserve. They'll have 300, 400, 500, 600 thousand people. You won't even read about it. When other people show up, you read big-time about it. Right? So, it's not fair, but nothing fair about the media. [Laughter]
Nothing. [Applause] A long-standing policy to ensure taxpayer dollars do not fund abortion services overseas. [Applause] We have issued executive orders to remove wasteful regulations that slow down commerce and delay infrastructure -- which we desperately need. The very beginning of a massive effort to reduce the crushing regulations on our economy and we are going to reduce regulations big-time. [Applause]
We've also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, paving the way for new one-on-one trade deals that protect and defend the American worker, and believe me, we're gonna have a lot of trade deals -- Mitch, don't worry about it. [Laughter] Just give me a little time. [Laughter]
But they'll be one-on-one. They won't be whole big mashed pot. They'll be one-on-one deals. And if that particular country doesn't treat us fairly, we send them a 30 day termination -- notice of termination. And they'll come and say, please don't do that and we'll negotiate a better deal during that 30 day period. The other way, you cannot get out of it, it's like quicksand.
Plus, we're going to have very, very strong controls over monetary manipulation and devaluation, which they didn't have in TPP. So this is gonna be so much better and we're already on it. I would like to have my Commerce Secretary Wilbur approved because I hear he did fantastically well, but they're not quick with the pen on signing these people. Because we'd like to him approved as soon as possible.
So -- I know, and Mitch says it will be done and it will be. They could move faster on the other side. I will say that. [Laughter] Could move faster. [Applause]
I mean, I'm meeting with the prime minister tomorrow, as you know. Great Britain. So, I'm meeting with her tomorrow, I don't have my commerce secretary -- they want to talk trade. So, I'll have to handle it myself. [Laughter] Which is OK. [Applause]
We've put in place the first steps in our immigration plan, ordering the immediate construction of the border wall, putting an end to catch and release, expediting the removal of criminal -- this is so important to me. From day one I've said it, and I mean the immediate removal of criminal aliens. They're gonna be gone, fast. [Applause]
And finally... [Applause] .... at long last, cracking down on sanctuary cities. [Applause]
It's time to restore the civil rights of Americans, to protect their jobs, their hopes and their dreams for a much better future. Congress passed these laws to serve our citizens and it's about time those laws were properly enforced. They're not enforced. [Applause]
The hour of justice for the American worker has arrived. Border security is a serious, serious national issue and problem. A lack of security poses a substantial threat to the sovereignty and safety of the United States of America and its citizens.
Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border. I've said many times that the American people will not pay for the wall. And I've made that clear to the government of Mexico.
NAFTA has been a terrible deal, a total disaster for the United States from its inception, costing us as much as $60 billion a year with Mexico alone in trade deficits. You say, who negotiates these deals? Not to mention, millions of jobs and thousands and thousands of factories and plants closing down all over our country.
On top of that are the trillions of dollars the U.S. taxpayers have spent to pay the costs of illegal immigration. Much of it is then been sent back, and much of it goes back to other countries, and oftentimes because they don't respect us, the other countries will not accept the criminals that we send back to them that are illegally in our country. I promise you, they will start accepting them again, quickly. We are not going to them any longer. [Applause]
I will not allow the taxpayers or the citizens of the United States to pay the costs of this defective transaction, NAFTA, one that should have been renegotiated many years ago except the politicians were too preoccupied to do so. Now these people are not in that category, you understand. This is a different group. I think. Right? [Laughter]
To that end, the president of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week. Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless and I want to go in different route. We have no choice.
Paul Ryan and other leaders in Congress and I, and Mike Pence -- how good a choice was vice president Mike Pence?
Stand up. [Applause] Everybody loves him. [Applause] In fact, anytime I got myself into a jam early -- you know, I haven't been doing this stuff too long, but any time I got myself into a jam, oftentimes they'd say on television, yes, but look, he picked Mike Pence, so he's got to have something going, right? [Laughter] So Mike really helped me out.
Well, we're working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route. It is time that the American people had a president fighting as hard for its citizens as other countries do for theirs, and that's exactly what I'm going to do for you. Believe me. [Applause]
Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause] It's time that somebody fought for our country and didn't let anyone take advantage of us anymore. The world has taken advantage of us for many years. Not going to happen anymore. We will have an ambitious legislative agenda as well. Our legislative work starts with repealing and replacing Obamacare. [Applause]
And saving families from the catastrophic rise in premiums and debilitating loss of choice and just about everything else. And remember this for this room in particular -- Obamacare is a disaster. The Democrats are up and they're saying, oh, they're putting up signs like it's wonderful. It's a disaster.
I actually talked with Paul and the group about just doing nothing for two years, and the Dems would come begging to do something because '17 is going to be catastrophic price increases. Your deductibles are through the roof. You can't use it. Can't use it.
And they would come to us, except we have one problem. We have to take care of the American people immediately. [Applause] So we can't wait. [Applause]
But every time they tell you about Obamacare, we're taking them out a big jam -- big jam. We're putting ourselves at risk, to a certain extent, because we're taking it off their platter. But I think, Congressman, I think we have no choice. I think we have no choice. We have to get it going.
I'm serious. If we waited two years, it's going to explode like you've never seen an explosion. Nobody's going to be able to afford it. It's a disaster.
And that's politically what we should do, but we don't want to do that. We want to get something done and get it done right. And by the way, Tom Price is going to do a phenomenal job. [Applause] I don't know if he's here, but he's going to do a phenomenal job. [Applause]
On my first day in office, I signed an executive order to roll back the burdens of Obamacare and pave the way for real reform, like health savings accounts that empower individuals to choose the customized plan that is truly right for them. They'd have so many choices.
Tom Price will soon be leading Health and Human Services. He is a true advocate for patients. He's going to do a phenomenal job. We have no doubt about that. He joins an all-star roster that includes many of your colleagues -- Ryan Zinke, Mick Mulvaney. These guys have had a pretty tough time in Congress, too, but they -- in the Senate, but actually came out very well -- Mike Pompeo.
Is Mike here? Mike? Mike Pompeo, phenomenal guy; and Jeff Sessions. Jeff is a fine person. [Applause]
Jeff was one of my earliest endorsers and never endorsed a presidential candidate before, and he was one of my earliest endorsers, respected by everybody. And did unbelievably in front of committee; unbelievably.
In addition to fixing our healthcare, we're going to pursue new trade deals that create higher wages and more opportunities for American workers, bringing back those magnificent words, made in the USA."" We used to have that. We don't have it anymore. [Applause]""""n addition to fixing our healthcare
It's going to be America first again. We will create millions of new good-paying jobs by removing the economic burdens that cripple our ability to compete. At the center of that agenda is bold tax reform that massively lowers taxes for our middle class and for all American businesses. [Applause]
We will also pursue financial reforms that will help striving Americans get the credit they need to realize their dreams. Republicans have always been the party of American industry and the American worker. We must embrace that heritage, rebuilding this country with American goods and American labor. And we've started, believe me, over the last couple of months.
I don't know, I'd like to say I did about as much as anybody or more in terms of getting industry to start coming back to our country before I took office. But we have a lot of great news with Ford and General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler and so many others. We have a lot of great news -- Lockheed is adding a lot of people, a lot of additional people; Boeing. We have a lot of positive things happening, and it's really going to start bursting out. You're going to be seeing it very soon.
We want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. So important. [Applause]
It's out of control. It's out of control. And we believe that the world's best country ought to have the world's best infrastructure. It's what our people deserve. And it's what we will ensure they get. Our infrastructure is in serious trouble. We will build new roads and highways and tunnels and airports and railways across the nation. We will fix our existing product before we build anything brand new, however. We have to fix what we have. It's a mess.
So we're going to fix it first. The thing I do best in life is build. We will fix it first because we have a lot of things that are in bad shape. And we will rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [Applause]) Thank you.
And we're working hard with the veterans. We're going to do something very special with the veterans. It's time. At the same time, we will unleash the full power of American energy, ending the job killing restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas and clean beautiful coal. And we're gonna put our coal miners back to work. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause]
And we will protect our farmers, our ranchers, our hunters, our anglers and all who enjoy the outdoors. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.
Right now, too many families don't feel secure, just look at the 30 largest cities. In the last year alone, the murder rate has increased by an estimated 14 percent. Here in Philadelphia, the murder rate has been steady -- I mean just terribly increasing. And then you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago? I said the other day, what the hell is going on?
Democrats. [Laughter]
A lot of truth to it. [Laughter] That is why we will continue to stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [Applause] Yesterday, I had the honor of swearing in General John Kelly as our secretary of Homeland Security, he's gonna be amazing. [Applause] Tomorrow, I will swear in General James Mattis as our new secretary of Defense. [Applause]
These men have devoted their lives to defending America, and now, I look forward to working with them, along with our great new head of the CIA -- you know we have -- we have so many different people that we are putting in office, I think it's the group of all-stars like really, nobody has seen before, right? Where is -- where is Pompeo? Where the hell is he? Did he ever come here? [Crosstalk]
He's working? [Laughter] He is -- he is so -- he's gonna be another one of the big stars. I have to mention him every single time. He's gonna be great --- one of you. [Applause]
And with you in Congress to keep our country safe from the many threats we face today, that includes protecting Americans from radical Islamic terrorism. [Applause] We also need to keep the ballot box safe from illegal voting. And believe me... [Applause]
... you take a look at what's registering, folks. They like to say Trump, Trump, Trump. Take a look at what's registering. We are going to protect the integrity of the ballot box and we are going to defend the votes of the American citizen, so important.
All of us here today, for the same reason, to serve the citizens of our country. We are not here for ourselves, we are here for them. We are here for the people. We are blessed by divinity, and honored by history, with the task of preserving this great republic and expanding its blessings to every single American. [Applause]
Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause] All of us are joined in this effort. All of us are bound by duty and bound by God to give our full devotion to this country and its people. That obligation forms the moral foundation of our agenda. That agenda includes a lean, efficient government. Appointing Supreme Court Justices, so important. [Applause]
Who will uphold and defend our Constitution, reducing taxation and regulation. Fair trade that creates a level playing field as opposed to what we have right now. And fostering respect for our country and its flag. We are now only at the beginning of this incredible journey together. I am honored to be your partner in this amazing quest. I am privileged to stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, as we work every single day to make America great again.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. It's a great honor to be here. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you."
2017-01-25,"Remarks: Donald Trump - Department of Homeland Security, Janaury 25, 2017","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-january-25-2017,"That's a great-looking group. thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bery proud of you. Thank you.
Wow you love your job don't you? Huh, that's beautiful. That's so nice. Great people. Thank you.
First I want to congratulate Secretary John Kelly and his wife Kathleen... where is Kathleen? She's here someplace [Applause].
John brings the skills the leadership background, the experience strength and definitely that determination that you have to have to get the job done and to get it done correctly.
He will deliver for you. He will deliver for the country. He will deliver for the American people like you've never seen before. [Applause]
We also just finished a briefing with the acting administrator of FEMA Bob Fenton, and we discussed the terrible storms that struck the southeastern United States. Our nation sends its thoughts and prayers to everyone impacted by this incredible tragedy.
I've instructed FEMA to do all they can to help those suffering and affected.Aalready we've approved Georgia and Mississippi and others are rapidly on their way so the team has done an incredible job of speed and they need speed.
Homeland Security is in the business of saving lives and that mandate will guide our actions. The Department of Homeland Security has many, many different divisions but one of the most important missions of DHS is its law enforcement mission. This is a law enforcement agency, but for too long your office's had agents haven't been allowed to properly do their jobs. You know that right? You know that absolutely. But that's all about to change, and I'm very happy about it and you're very happy about it.
From here on out I'm asking all of you to enforce the laws of the United States of America. They will be enforced and enforced strongly because people are surprised to hear that we do not need new laws. We will work within the existing system and framework. We are going to restore all the rule of law in the United States.
Before we go any further I want to recognize the ICE and Border Patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president. That helps, but that's not the only reason.
I also want to acknowledge two individuals in the audience who will play a very very important role going forward. I'd like to recognize Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council and Chris Crane, friends of mine and President of National ICE Council. You guys are about to be very, very busy doing your job the way you want to do and... where are they? Where are those guys?
Thank you fellas. Thank you very much. We're in the middle of a crisis on our southern border. The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States and i believe the steps we will take starting right now will improve the safety in both of our countries. It's going to be very, very good for Mexico.
A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders. Thank you. I just signed two executive orders that will save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars. These two orders are part of an immigration reform we outlined during the campaign. I want to emphasize that we will be working in partnership with our friends in Mexico to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border.
I have deep admiration for the people of Mexico and I greatly look forward to meeting again with the President of Mexico. I will be doing that shortly. We will discuss close coordination on many many important issues between our countries.
This coordination includes the dismantling of cartels and keeping illegal weapons and cash from flowing out of America and into Mexico. Out of our country, out of the United States, and it goes right into Mexico.
They have to stop it. We have to stop it. We are going to save lives on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States. Very, very good. We want that to happen by working together on a positive trade, safe borders and economic cooperation. I truly believe we can enhance the relation between our two nations to a degree not seen before, certainly in a very very long time.
I think our relationship with Mexico is going to get better. Here's a brief summary of what actions are contained in my executive orders. The Secretary of Homeland Security, working with myself and my staff, will begin immediate construction of a border wall so badly needed. You folks know how badly needed it is... as a help but very badly needed. This will also help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration from Central America and by disrupting violent cartel networks.
As I've said repeatedly to the country, we are going to get the bad ones out, the criminals and the drug dealers and gangs and gang members and cartel leaders. The day is over when they can stay in our country and wreak havoc. We are going to get them out and we're going to get them out fast and John Kelly is going to lead that.
Our way our also does the following: ends the policy of catch-and-release at the border, requires other countries to take back their criminals.. they will take them back, cracks down on sanctuary cities, empowers ICE officers to target and remove those who pose a threat to public safety, calls for the hiring of another 5,000 border patrol officers, calls for the tripling the number of ICE offices, and you both do an incredible job but you need help you need more.
Creates an Office of Homeland Security dedicated to supporting the victims of illegal immigrant crime. For years the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders. To all of those hurting out there, I repeat to you these words: we hear you, we see you and you will never ever be ignored again.
As I travel the countrym, I had the chance to get to know mothers who have lost their children to violence spilling over the border. I want to thank the remembrance project, such incredible people, for giving these families voice. They're called Angel Moms for good reason because they are a voice to protect all of America's children. Their children have not died in vain, believe me.
Pundits talk about how enforcing immigration laws can separate illegal immigrant families, but the families they don't talk about are the families of Americans forever separated from the people they love. They don't talk about that ever. As your president, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people first. These families lost their loved ones, then they endured a system that ignored them while at the same time constantly rewarding those who broke the law.
For these families, it's been one injustice after another. But that all turns around beginning today. We are joined here this afternoon by parents whose children were horribly killed by individuals living here illegally.
I will now read these parents names and ask them to stand. Many have become friends of mine over the last two years and have supported me so dearly and I appreciate it. Marianne Mendoza,  who lost her son, police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza [Applause]. Fred Funderburgh and his son, James, who lost Billy. Billy was Fredâs son and Jamesâs brother. Billyâs wife, Natalie, was also killed by an illegal immigrant. Somebody that should never ever have been here. [Applause]
Laura Wilkerson who lost her 17-year-old son, beautiful Josh. Josh was special. Where is Laura? Good. [Applause]
Thank you. Kerry Ruiz and Lucia Ruiz, Jr. who lost their young daughter, Felicia. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]
Stephen Ronabeck who lost his 21-year-old son, Grant. Thank you, Stephen. [Applause]
Thank you and we have many others with us from remembrance, and from other groups, and these are incredible people that have endured so much and I just want to thank everybody for being very, very special people.
Nothing can ever make their pain go away, but I want you to know your children will not have lost their lives for no reason. They've set this incredible goal for so many these were great young people, and they will always be remembered, always.
We will never forget them, and to the parents and loved ones, you kept the flame of justice alive with your activism. Keep it going, and now together we will save thousands and thousands of lives. When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics. No Republicans, no Democrats. Just citizens and good citizens.
We want safe communities and we demand safe communities for everyone. We want respect. We want great schools. We want dignity and equality for everyone, and i will be a President. I promised you for everyone, we will bridge our divisions, heal our wounds and unify our country. And if we do that if we work together then there is nothing we cannot achieve as Americans. The future is limitless. Good luck to our new and brilliant leader at DHS general John Kelly. Thank you .
God bless you and God bless America congratulations to John."
2017-01-22,"Remarks: Donald Trump - Washington DC, January 22, 2017","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-january-22-2017,"Thank you very much. Very Nice.
I just went to the Oval Office and found this beautiful letter from President Obama. It was really very nice of him to do that and we will cherish that we will keep that and we won't even tell the press what's in that letter.
I want to start off by telling you i just spoke with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia, great state great people. Florida affected, Alabama affected by the tornadoes, and just express our sincere condolences for the lives taken.
Tornadoes were vicious and powerful and strong and they suffered greatly so we'll be helping out the state of Georgia. Will be speaking with Governor Scott right after this and will be...
Alabama's special places. Florida special place.
but they got hit hard they all got hit hard but looks like Georgia's lost at least 11 people as of this moment. A lot of people so on behalf of all of us, Governor Deal, condolences.
We are going to tell you that this has been a very interesting few days. We have set up meetings with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister may will be coming over to the United States shortly.
We're also meeting with the Prime Minister of Canada and we will be meeting with the president of Mexico, you know and we're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA. Anybody ever hear of NAFTA? I ran the campaign somewhat based on NAFTA but we're going to start renegotiating after on immigration and on security at the border.
And Mexico has been terrific,  actually terrific and the president has been really very amazing and I think we're going to have a very good result for Mexico, for the United States, for everybody involved very important very very important thing. And speaking of important you are very mportant because with you and all of the people in this room we are going to do some great things over the next eight years and...
all right right great group. It's a great group of people and if they're not I will let you know about this.
The bad news about being the fact we'll let you know if they're not doing the job. ok i'll praise Him of they're doing and I'll let you know if they're not doing it, but they will do they can do a fantastic job.
I'm so proud of him I know him so well. Each and every one of you should be extremely proud.
Give yourselves a round of applause. Come on give yourselves a round of applause.
To your family and friends we are gathered here today. I want them all to know how important you are to the functioning of the White House and ultimately to the functioning of the United States of America.
I also want to thank the families here today for all you have done to support your loved ones as they've devoted their time and energy to causes of public service including many long nights. They'll be away long nights and they will go on for a long, long time but we're going to come out way ahead.
We're going to come out way ahead as a nation as a country can come out way ahead, because I know what we have. I know how talented these people are.
We're also a team, a team great team it's a team that gets along. And as I said during my inaugural address, this is not about party, this is not about ideology.
This is about country, our country and it's about serving the American people. We're not here to help ourselves.
We're here to devote ourselves to the National good. Public service is a high-end great calling.
It's our solemn duty together, to protect the country. Our country.
This great great country to defend its workers and promote the well-being of all Americans. So many people are depending on us, and on you.
As families, you as people that are going to get it done. So many people, the veterans the unemployed men and women serving in harm's way overseas, victims of crime and young Americans looking to fulfill their dreams.
So many of those young Americans and they're going to be fulfilling their dreams we're going to make it much easier for them. We will face many challenges, but with the faith in each other and the faith in God we will get the job done.
We will prove worthy of this moment in history and I think it may very well be a great moment in history. So be proud, be very clear.
Now I began with this gentleman right here. He said Mike how about it and he said not even a question and it was a great decision from me.
So Mike Pence, our fabulous Vice President of the United States will administer the oath of office and congratulations to everybody. Congratulations."
2017-01-21,Remarks: Donald Trump at CIA Headquarters,"McLean, VA, United States","[-77.1772604, 38.9338676]",donald-trump-speech-video-mclean-va-january-21-2017,"Well, I want to thank everybody. Very, very special people. And it is true, this is my first stop, officially. We're not talking about the balls, or we're not talking about even the speeches -- although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday. [Laughter] I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely. [Laughter]
But I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump. There's nobody. [Applause]
The wall behind me is very, very special. We've been touring for quite a while, and I'll tell you what -- 29? I can't believe it.
Unidentified Male : Twenty-eight.
Oh, 28. We got to reduce it. That's amazing. And we really appreciate what you've done in terms of showing us something very special. And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people. Very, very few people could do the job you people do. And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you. And I know maybe sometimes you haven't gotten the backing that you've wanted, and you're going to get so much backing. Maybe you're going to say, please don't give us so much backing. [Laughter] Mr. President, please, we don't need that much backing. [Laughter] But you're going to have that. And I think everybody in this room knows it.
You know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it -- but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes. We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military. And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did. [Laughter] But I would guarantee a big portion, because we're all on the same wavelength, folks. [Applause] We're all on the same wavelength, right? He knows. It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we're on the same wavelength.
But we're going to do great things. We're going to do great things. We've been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we've ever fought. We have not used the real abilities that we have. We've been restrained. We have to get rid of ISIS. Have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. [Applause] Radical Islamic terrorism. And I said it yesterday -- it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth. This is evil. This is evil. And you know, I can understand the other side. We can all understand the other side. There can be wars between countries, there can be wars. You can understand what happened. This is something nobody can even understand. This is a level of evil that we haven't seen. And you're going to go to it, and you're going to do a phenomenal job. But we're going to end it. It's time. It's time right now to end it.
You have somebody coming on who is extraordinary. For the different positions of Secretary of This"" and ""Secretary of That"" and all of these great positions
But we did -- we had such a tremendous, tremendous success. So when I'm interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly -- because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia. Fantastic guy. But I'd see six, seven, eight people for a certain position. Everybody wanted it.
But I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met. I didn't want to meet anybody else. I said, cancel everybody else. Cancel. Now, he was approved, essentially, but they're doing little political games with me. He was one of the three. Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved. [Applause] And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group. It was going to be the three of them. Can you imagine all of these guys? People respect -- you know, they respect that military sense. All my political people, they're not doing so well. The political people aren't doing so well but you. We're going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others.
But Mike was literally -- I had a group of -- what, we had nine different people? Now, I must say, I didn't mind cancelling eight appointments. That wasn't the worst thing in the world. But I met him and I said, he is so good. Number one in his class at West Point.
Now, I know a lot about West Point. I'm a person that very strongly believes in academics. In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically -- was an academic genius -- and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I'm like a smart persona. [Laughter] And I recognized immediately. So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School. And then he decided to go into the military. And he ran for Congress. And everything he's done has been a homerun. People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him. And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled -- right, Mike? Because he said, I don't want to lose this guy.
But you will be getting a total star. You're going to be getting a total gem. He's a gem. [Applause] You'll see. You'll see. And many of you know him anyway. But you're going to see. And again, we have some great people going in. But this one is something -- is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps -- you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important. You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing. And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful. But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier. And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly. And that's what we have to do. We have to start winning again.
You know, when I was young and when I was -- of course, I feel young. I feel like I'm 30, 35, 39. [Laughter] Somebody said, are you young? I said, I think I'm young. You know, I was stopping -- when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops. Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop. I feel young.
When I was young -- and I think we're all sort of young. When I was young, we were always winning things in this country. We'd win with trade. We'd win with wars. At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, The United States has never lost a war."" And then
I believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems. We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don't even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused. So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent.
And the reason you're my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. [Laughter]and [Applause] And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the number-one stop is exactly the opposite -- exactly. And they understand that, too.
And I was explaining about the numbers. We did a thing yesterday at the speech. Did everybody like the speech? [Applause] I've been given good reviews. But we had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I say, wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well. I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we're not going to let it rain on your speech.
In fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no. The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops. And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we'll go right through it. But the truth is that it stopped immediately. It was amazing. And then it became really sunny. And then I walked off and it poured right after I left. It poured. But, you know, we have something that's amazing because we had -- it looked -- honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on -- and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad, but it's a lie. We had 250,000 people literally around -- you know, in the little bowl that we constructed. That was 250,000 people. The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed. So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty. And I think they're going to pay a big price.
We had another one yesterday, which was interesting. In the Oval Office there's a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King. And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill. I think most of us like Churchill. He doesn't come from our country, but had a lot to do with it. Helped us; real ally. And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out -- the bust. And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly. And they wanted to know whether or not I'd like it back. I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill.
So a reporter for Time magazine -- and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times. I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine. Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it's one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right? [Laughter] I've been on it for 15 times this year. I don't think that's a record, Mike, that can ever be broken. Do you agree with that? What do you think?
But I will say that they said -- it was very interesting -- that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But there was a cameraman that was in front of it. [Laughter] So Zeke -- Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down. I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is.
Now, the big story -- the retraction was, like, where? Was it a line? Or do they even bother putting it in? So I only like to say that because I love honesty. I like honest reporting.
I will tell you, final time -- although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in -- because I am coming back -- we're going to have to get you a larger room. [Applause] We may have to get you a larger room. You know? And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won't have columns. [Laughter] You understand that? [Applause] We get rid of the columns.
No, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you. There's nobody I respect more. You're going to do a fantastic job. And we're going to start winning again, and you're going to be leading the charge.
So thank you all very much. [Applause] Thank you -- you're beautiful. Thank you all very much. Have a good time. I'll be back. I'll be back. Thank you."
2017-01-20,"Speech: Donald Trump Inauguration Speech in Washington, DC","Washington, DC, United States","[-77.0368707, 38.9071923]",donald-trump-speech-washington-dc-january-20-2017,"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.
We, the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done. Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.
Todayâs ceremony however, has very special meaning, because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC. And giving it back to you, the people.
For too long, have reaped the rewards of government while people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered period, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It be longs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.
What truly matters is not what truly controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
Everyone is listening to you now, you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.
These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge. And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
We have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own. And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. Weâve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the pass and now we are looking only to the future.
We assemble here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body. And I will never ever let you down.
America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.
We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules, buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for everyone to follow.
We will reinforce old alliances and form new wurns and reform the world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god's people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue sold art. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
There should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
Finally, must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail.
Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the missries of disease and harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms. And we all salute the same great American flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of nebraska, they look at the same night sky. They fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words, you will never be ignored again.
Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make america strong again. We will make america wealthy again. We will make america proud again.
We will make America safe again. And yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. And god bless America. Thank you. God bless America."
