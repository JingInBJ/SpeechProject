Roberts administers the Oath of Office]I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of the President of the United States faithfully1, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God.Thank you, thank you.My fellow citizens:I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the Oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers [sic], and true to our founding documents.So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to \"set aside childish things.\"2 The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.All this we can do.All this we will do.Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers -- Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake. And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And we are ready to lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you!For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those -- To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.This is the price and the promise of citizenship.This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred Oath.So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The Capitol was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "First Presidential Weekly Speech", "article": "<p>[as prepared for delivery]We begin this year and this Administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action. Just this week, we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last twenty-six years, and experts agree that if nothing is done, the unemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four. And we could lose a generation of potential, as more young Americans are forced to forgo college dreams or the chance to train for the jobs of the future.In short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.That is why I have proposed an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan to immediately jumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth. I am pleased to say that both parties in Congress are already hard at work on this plan, and I hope to sign it into law in less than a month.It\u0092s a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and one that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there are millions of Americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, there\u0092s so much work to be done. That\u0092s why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment. It\u0092s one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education; health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.Today I\u0092d like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas.To accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generate alternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years. We\u0092ll begin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission lines to convey this new energy from coast to coast. We\u0092ll save taxpayers $2 billion a year by making 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family $350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes.To lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, we\u0092ll computerize the nation\u0092s health record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives. And we\u0092ll protect health insurance for more than 8 million Americans who are in danger of losing their coverage during this economic downturn.To ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, we\u0092ll renovate and modernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improve learning for over five million students. We\u0092ll invest more in Pell Grants to make college affordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four million students, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation of innovation.Finally, we will rebuild and retrofit America to meet the demands of the 21st century. That means repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of America\u0092s roadways and providing new mass transit options for millions of Americans. It means protecting America by securing 90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement and public safety officials in the event of an emergency. And it means expanding broadband access to millions of Americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, wherever they\u0092re located.I know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan. I understand that skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedented measures that will allow the American people to hold my Administration accountable for these results. We won\u0092t just throw money at our problems -- we\u0092ll invest in what works. Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible. We\u0092ll launch an unprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in our government, and every American will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayer dollars by going to a new website called </p><p>recovery.gov.No one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recede in a short period of time. But if we act now and act boldly; if we start rewarding hard work and responsibility once more; if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the work of remaking America, then I have faith that we will emerge from this trying time even stronger and more prosperous than we were before.Thanks for listening.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0368707, 38.9071923]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "White House, Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Al-Arabiya Television Interview", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from edited audio above]</p><p>Mr. Melhem: Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity -- we really appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Thank you so much.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Sir, you just met with your personal envoy to the Middle East, Senator Mitchell. Obviously, his first -- first task is to consolidate the cease-fire. But beyond that you've been saying that you want to pursue actively and aggressively peacemaking between the Palestinians and...the Israelis. Tell us a little bit about how do you see your personal role, because, you know, if the President of the United States is not involved, nothing happens -- as the history of peace making shows. Will you be proposing ideas, pitching proposals, parameters, as one of your predecessors did? Or just urging the parties to come up with their own resolutions, as -- as your immediate predecessor did?</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Well, I -- I think the -- the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away.</p><p>Mr. Melhem:Right.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:  And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals.</p><p>And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often theUnited States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues -- and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So, let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved and he will then report back to me. From there, we will formulate a specific response.</p><p>Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people, and that, instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table.</p><p>It's going to be difficult; it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: You've been saying essentially that we should not look at these issues -- like the Palestinian-Israeli track and separation from the border region -- you've been talking about a kind of holistic approach to the region. Are we expecting a different paradigm in the sense that in the past one of the critiques -- at least from the Arab side, the Muslim side -- is that everything the Americans always test -- tested with the Israelis, if it works. Now there is an Arab peace plan, there is a regional aspect to it. And -- And you've indicated that. Would there be any shift, a paradigm shift?</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Well -- Well, here's what I think is important. You look at the proposal that was put forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia --</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Right.</p><p>President Obama: I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal, but it took great courage --</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Absolutely.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: -- to put forward something that is as significant as that.I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace.I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of thePalestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p><p>Mr. Melhem: Sure.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:  These things are interrelated. </p><p>Mr. Melhem: Sure.</p><p>President Obama: </p><p>And what I've said -- and I think Hillary Clinton has expressed this in her confirmation -- is that if we are looking at the region as a whole and communicating a message to the Arab world and the Muslim world, that we are ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest, then I think that we can make significant progress.Now, Israel is a strong ally of the United States. They will not stop being a strong ally of the United States. And I will continue to believe that Israel's security is paramount. But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that it is important to achieve peace. They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side.</p><p>And so what we want to do is to listen, set aside some of the preconceptions that have existed and -- and have built up over the last several years. And I think if we do that, then there's a possibility at least of -- of achieving some breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Now I want to ask you about the broader Muslim world, but let me -- one final thing about the Palestinian-Israeli theater. There are many Palestinians and Israelis who are very frustrated now with the -- with the current conditions and they are losing hope; they are disillusioned; and they believe that time is running out on the two-state solution because -- mainly because of the -- the settlement activities in...Palestinian-occupied territories.Will it still be possible to see a Palestinian state -- and you know the contours of it -- within the first Obama Administration?President Obama: I think it is possible for us to see a Palestinian state -- I'm not going to put a time frame on it -- that is contiguous, that allows freedom of movement for its people, that allows for trade with other countries, that allows the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better life.And, look, I think anybody who has studied the region recognizes that the situation for the ordinary Palestinian in many cases has not improved. And the bottom line in all these talks and all these conversations is: Is a child in the Palestinian Territories going to be better off? Do they have a future for themselves? And, is the child in Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security? And if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward, and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past, then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress.But it is not going to be easy, and that's why we've got George Mitchell going there. This is somebody with extraordinary patience as well as extraordinary skill, and that's what's going to be necessary.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Let me take a broader look at the whole region. You are planning to </p><p>address the Muslim world in your first 100 days from a Muslim capital. And everybody is speculating about the capital. If you have anything further, that would be great. How concerned are you -- because, let me tell you, honestly, when I -- when I see certain things about America -- in some parts, I don't want to exaggerate -- there is a demonization of America.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Absolutely.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: It's become like a new religion, and like a new religion it has new converts, like a new religion has its own high priests.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Right.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: It's own, even, religious texts.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Right.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: And...in the last -- since 9/11 and because of Iraq, that alienation, you know, is -- is wider between the Americans. And...in generations past, the United States was held high. It was the only Western power with no colonial legacy.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Right.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: How concerned are you and...because people sense that you have a different political discourse. And...I think, judging by [inaudible] andZawahiri and Osama bin Laden and all these, that... --</p><p>President Obama: Yeah, I noticed.Mr. Melhem:\u00a0 -- a chorus --</p><p></p><p>President Obama:  They -- They seem nervous.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: They seem very nervous, exactly. And...now, tell me why they should be more nervous? President Obama: Well...I think that when you look at the rhetoric that they've been using against me before I even took office --</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: I know, I know.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: -- what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt.</p><p>Mr. Melhem: Absolutely.</p><p>President Obama: ...There's no actions that they've taken that say a child in the Muslim world is getting a better education because of them, or has better health care because of them.</p><p>In my inauguration speech, I've spoke[n] about: You will be judged on what you built, not what you destroy. And what they've been doing is destroying things. And over time, I think the Muslim world has recognized that that path is leading no place, except more death and destruction. </p><p>Now, my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well-being of the Muslim world that the language we use has to be language of respect. You know, I have Muslim members of my family.</p><p>Mr. Melhem:  True.</p><p>President Obama:  I have lived in Muslim countries.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: The largest one.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: The largest one, Indonesia. And so what I want tocommunicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim world, what I've come to understand is is that regardless of your faith -- and America is a country of Muslim[s], Jews, Christians, non-believers -- regardless of your faith, people all have certain common hopes and common dreams.And my job is to communicate to the American people -- </p><p>Mr. Melhem: True.</p><p>President Obama:  -- that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live better lives. My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago -- </p><p>Mr. Melhem: True.</p><p>President Obama: -- there's no reason why we can't restore that. And -- And that I think is going to be an important task.But ultimately, people are going to judge me not by my words but by my actions and my Administration's actions. And I think that what you will see over the next several years is that I'm not going to agree with everything that some Muslim leader may say, or what's on a television station in the Arab world; but I think that what you'll see is somebody who is listening, who is respectful, and who is trying to promote the interests not just of the United States, but also ordinary people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of opportunity. I want to make sure that I'm speaking to them, as well.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: And any decision on -- on from where you will -- you will be addressing the Muslim world or is too early?</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Well, you know, I'm not -- I'm not going to break the news right here. </p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Maybe next time?</p><p></p><p>President Obama: But maybe next time. ...But it is something that's going to be important.</p><p>Mr. Melhem: True. </p><p>President Obama:  I -- I want people to recognize, though, that we are going to be making a series of initiatives. Us sending George Mitchell --</p><p>Mr. Melhem: Right. True. </p><p>President Obama: --  to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that we're not going to wait until the end of my Administration to deal with Palestinian and -- and Israeli peace. We're going to start now. It may take a long time to do -- </p><p>Mr. Melhem: Sure.</p><p>President Obama: -- but we're going to do it now. We're going to follow through on our commitmentfor me to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital. We are going to follow through on many of my commitments to do a more effective job of reaching out, listening, as well as speaking to the Muslim world.</p><p>And I-- you're going to see me following through with dealing with a drawdown of troops in Iraq, so that Iraqis can start taking more responsibility. And finally, I think you've already seen a commitment, in terms of closing Guantanamo -- </p><p>Mr. Melhem: Absolutely.</p><p>President Obama: -- and making clear that even as we are decisive in going after terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, that we're going to do so on our terms, and we're going to do so respecting the rule of law that I think makes America great.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: President Bush framed the war on -- on terror conceptually in a -- in a way that was very broad, \"War on terror,\" and he used sometimes certain terminology that the -- that the many people -- \"Islamofascism.\"1</p><p>President Obama: Right.</p><p>Mr. Melhem:  You've always framed it in a different way, specifically against one group called al Qaeda --</p><p>President Obama: Right.</p><p>Mr. Melhem: --  and their collaborators. And -- And is this one way of --</p><p></p><p>President Obama: ...I think that you're making a very important point. And -- And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.And so you will I think see our Administration be very clear indistinguishing between organizations like al Qaeda -- that espouse violence -- </p><p>Mr. Melhem: Right.</p><p>President Obama: -- espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my Administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements</p><p>Mr. Melhem: True.</p><p>President Obama: --  but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians and we will hunt them down.But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in...the direction of preventing it?</p><p></p><p>President Obama: You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran.</p><p>Now, the Iranian people are a great people. The Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region -- their threats against Israel, their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off a[n] arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been helpful.</p><p>But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will, over the next several months, be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my </p><p>inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.Mr. Melhem: Sir, I really appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Thank you so much.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Thanks a lot.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: I appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Melhem: Thank you.</p><p></p><p>President Obama: Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0365298, 38.8976763]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Grand Foyer, The White House", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Executive Compensation Salary Cap Speech", "article": "<p>Thank you, Tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery. The economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. It's a crisis of falling confidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward; a crisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mighty financial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many people across this country and cost the economy 2.6 million jobs last year alone.</p><p>We know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making, and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around.</p><p>But make no mistake: A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future. Millions more jobs will be lost. More businesses will be shuttered. More dreams will be deferred.</p><p>And that's why I feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestment plan that is before Congress today. With it, we can save or create more than three million jobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come. It's not merely a prescription for short-term spending -- it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areas like renewable energy and health care and education.</p><p>Now, in the past few days I've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and these criticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the first place -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can ignore fundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care; that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and our country to thrive.</p><p>I reject those theories. And so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act without delay. No plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger. No one is more committed to making it stronger than me. But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential. Let's show people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that we are equal to the task.</p><p>At the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part of what we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future. We also need a strong and viable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike. And my administration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system. Our recovery depends on it. And so in the next week, Secretary Geithner will release a new strategy to get credit moving again -- a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while laying the foundation of the future.</p><p>But in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than just put forward our plans. In order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer funds are not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street.</p><p>We all need to take responsibility. And this includes executives at major financial firms who turned to the American people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paid themselves customary lavish bonuses. As I said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility. It's shameful. And that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain at the expense of everything else.</p><p>This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achieving success. And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets people upset -- and rightfully so -- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those rewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough time themselves.</p><p>For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it as President. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so that when firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks.</p><p>As part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinary help from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars -- a fraction of the salaries that have been reported recently. And if these executives receive any additional compensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance.</p><p>Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks and luxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and to shareholders as to why these expenses are justified. And we're putting a stop to these kinds of massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust; we're taking the air out of golden parachutes.</p><p>We're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and their role in it. We believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basic common sense.</p><p>And finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-term effort. We're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality that in turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system. We're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, and rewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks. </p><p>We all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility. That's true here in Washington. That's true on Wall Street. The American people are carrying a huge burden as a result of this economic crisis: bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost of extraordinary measures we're taking to address them. The American people expect and demand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis -- and that will prevent these kinds of crises from occurring again in the future.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0365298, 38.8976763]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": NaN, "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "First Prime Time Press Conference", "article": "<p></p><p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Good evening, everybody. Please be seated. Before I take your questions tonight, I'd like to speak briefly about the state of our economy and why I believe we need to put this recovery plan in motion as soon as possible. I took a trip to Elkhart, Indiana, today. Elkhart is a place that has lost jobs faster than anywhere else in America. In one year, the unemployment rate went from 4.7 percent to 15.3 percent. Companies that have sustained this community for years are shedding jobs at an alarming speed, and the people who've lost them have no idea what to do or who to turn to. They can't pay their bill and they've stopped spending money. And because they've stopped spending money, more businesses have been forced to lay off more workers. In fact, local TV stations have started running public service announcements that tell people where to find food banks, even as the food banks don't have enough to meet the demand.As we speak, similar scenes are playing out in cities and towns across America. Last Monday, more than a thousand men and women stood in line for 35 firefighter jobs in Miami. Last month, our economy lost 598,000 jobs, which is nearly the equivalent of losing every single job in the state of Maine. And if there's anyone out there who still doesn't believe this constitutes a full-blown crisis, I suggest speaking to one of the millions of Americans whose lives have been turned upside down because they don't know where their next paycheck is coming from. And that is why the single most important part of this Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is the fact that it will save or create up to 4 million jobs, because that's what America needs most right now. It is absolutely true that we can't depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth. That is and must be the role of the private sector. But at this particular moment, with the private sector so weakened by this recession, the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy back into life. It is only government that can break the vicious cycle where lost jobs lead to people spending less money, which leads to even more layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the plan that's moving through Congress is designed to do.When passed, this plan will ensure that Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own can receive greater unemployment benefits and continue their health care coverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are struggling to pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth of badly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. These steps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who are most likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and get our economy moving. But as we've learned very clearly and conclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all of our economic problems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiest few Americans. We have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it's only helped lead us to the crisis we face right now. And that's why we have come together, around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for the middle class with direct investment in areas like health care, energy, education and infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, create new jobs and new businesses and help our economy grow again, now and in the future. More than 90 percent of the jobs created by this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to be make-work jobs but jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our dangerously deficient dams and levees, so that we don't face another Katrina.They'll be jobs building the wind turbines and solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower our dependence on foreign oil and modernizing our costly health care system that will save us billions of dollars and countless lives. </p><p>They'll be jobs creating the 21st-century classrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children across America. And they'll be the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide states with some relief. Now after many weeks of debate and discussion, the plan that ultimately emerges from Congress must be big enough and bold enough to meet the size of the economic challenges that we face right now. It's a plan that is already supported by businesses representing almost every industry in America, by both the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from both Democrats and Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability, so that every American will be able to go online and see where and how we're spending every dime. What it does not contain, however, is a single pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped of the projects members of both parties found most objectionable. Now despite all of this, the plan's not perfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this plan will work exactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that a failure to act will only deepen this crisis, as well as the pain felt by millions of Americans. My administration inherited a deficit of over $1 trillion, but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergency since the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will result in ever -- even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence. Those are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as I hold this office, I will do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and put this country back to work. I want to thank the members of Congress who've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also want to urge all members of Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolve their differences and pass this plan. We find ourselves in a rare moment where the citizens of our country and all countries are watching and waiting for us to lead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, but one that we must accept for the future of our children and our grandchildren. The strongest democracies flourish from frequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of every background and belief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of a greater purpose. That's the test facing the United States of America in this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders and citizens to stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and months ahead. After a day of speaking with and listening to the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nation home, I have full faith and confidence that we can do it. </p><p>But we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead. And with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let me go to Jennifer Loven at AP. There you are.</p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today in Indiana you said something striking. You said that this nation could end up in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what you're hearing that would lead you to say that our recession might be permanent when others in our history have not? And do you think that you risk losing some credibility or even talking down the economy by using dire language like that? </p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.</p><p>President Obama: No, no, no, no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum, which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, then you potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of. We saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s, where they did not act boldly and swiftly enough, and as a consequence they suffered what was called the \"lost decade,\" where essentially for the entire '90s, they did not see any significant economic growth. So what I'm trying to underscore is what the people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill recession. We are going through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've lost now 3.6 million jobs. But what's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job loss has taken place over the last three months, which means that the problems are accelerating instead of getting better. </p><p>Now, what I said in Elkhart today is what I'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that we can solve this problem, but it's going to require us to take some significant, important steps. Step number one, we have to pass an economic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made progress. There was a vote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. We already have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next several days that the House and the Senate can reconcile their differences and get that bill on my desk. There have been criticisms from a bunch of different directions about this bill. So let me just address a few of them. Some of the criticisms really are with the basic idea that government should intervene at all in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in the marketplace. And in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal. They're fighting battles that I thought were resolved a pretty long time ago. Most economists, almost unanimously, recognize that even if philosophically you're -- you're wary of government intervening in the economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now -- what started on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businesses can't get credit, they start paring back their investment, they start laying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending -- that when you have that situation, that government is an important element of introducing some additional demand into the economy. We stand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and another trillion next year, and what that means is you've got this gaping hole in the economy. That's why the -- the figure that we initially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward. That wasn't just some random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. That was Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal economists that I spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude of the crisis and the fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to have a bill of sufficient size and scope that we can save or create 4 million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net job loss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in the right direction.Now, the recovery and reinvestment package is not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool. We are still going to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get the credit markets flowing again, because that's the lifeblood of the economy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit once again.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.And that means having some transparency and oversight in the system. It means that we correct some of the mistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency, the lack of clarity, in terms of how the program was going to move forward. It means that we condition taxpayer dollars that are being provided, to the banks, on them showing some restraint when it comes to executive compensation, not using the money to charter corporate jets when they're not necessary. It means that we focus on housing and how are we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosure or homeowners who are still making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline. So there's going to be a whole range of approaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. My bottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making sure that the financial system is working again, that homeowners are getting some relief. And I'm happy to get good ideas from across the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans. What I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place, because those theories have been tested and they have failed. And that's part of what the election in November was all about. Okay? Caren Bohan of Reuters.</p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to shift gears to foreign policy. What is your strategy for engaging Iran, and when will you start to implement it? Will your time table be affected at all by the Iranian elections? And are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the United States? </p><p>President Obama: I said during the campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace.What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction. There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect and progress.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities. </p><p>Okay. </p><p>President Obama: Chip Reid. </p><p></p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. You have often said that bipartisanship is extraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. But now when we ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votes in the House, three in the Senate -- they say, well, it's not the number of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will be created. Is that a sign that you are moving away, your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on bipartisanship? And what went wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to change the way Washington worked? </p><p>President Obama: I don't think -- I don't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people underestimated it. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up here in Washington. And it's going to take time to break down some of those bad habits. You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republican caucuses, you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here to the White House, to talk about the economic recovery plan -- all those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try to build up some trust over time. And I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated. But understand the bottom line that I've got right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhart and what's happening across the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usual political games. What we have to do right now is deliver for the American people. So my bottom line when it comes to the recovery package is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, because everybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about putting people back to work, making sure that folks are staying in their homes, that they can send their kids to college. That doesn't negate the continuing efforts that I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republican colleagues. And hopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civil and respectful, will pay some dividends over the long term. There are going to be areas where we disagree and there are going to be areas where we agree. </p><p>As I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some of what's been said in Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don't doubt their sincerity -- who just believe that we should do nothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing position in negotiations, then we're probably not going to make much progress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I don't think what -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand by and do nothing. There are others who recognize that we've got to do a significant recovery package but they're concerned about the mix of what's in there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy to have conversations about this tax cut versus that -- that tax cut or this infrastructure project versus that infrastructure project.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.But what I -- what I've been concerned about is some of the language that's been used suggesting that this is full of pork and this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a doubling of the national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage in some revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we have right now and the economic crisis that we have right now. Number two is that, although there are some programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't job creators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs should be out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal with them later. But when they start characterizing this as pork without acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package -- something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then you get a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actually trying to solve problems for the American people. So I'm going to keep on engaging. I hope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing to give a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is not going to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is, are we creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation for long- term economic growth? This is another concern that I've had in some of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste of money to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that be a waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately by retrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economic stimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federal buildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they will see more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make that kind of investment? Now, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen to disagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselves importing more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s, when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate about whether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don't suggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly what this country needs. The same applies when it comes to information technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businesses and making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks of families all across America. And part of the reason is we've got the most inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still using paper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nurses can't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have written out. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on an electronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-term cost of health care, and create jobs right now?Education, yet another example. The suggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the 1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad, and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacher has to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium is completely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need for the 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, right now will create jobs?</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.So, you know, we can differ on some of the particulars, but again, the question I think that the American people are asking is, do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it to do something? If you want it to do something, then we can have a conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option from my perspective. All right. Chuck Todd. Where's Chuck? </p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan works the way you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumer spending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not want them saving it or paying down debt first, before they start spending money into the economy? </p><p>President Obama: Well, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies, based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make inventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy. So people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn made things worse. Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending and we're not making things, then over time, other countries are going to get tired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral. And that means putting money into consumers' pockets. It means loosening up credit. It means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth. And that by the way is important, even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest problem we're going to have, with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation in which there are no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for unemployment insurance; we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget. So the most important thing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that it's expensive.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn't how I envisioned my presidency beginning. But we have to adapt to existing circumstances. Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, investment begins again; we're no longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm and long-term budget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they're just trying to figure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.Or they're worried about, how am I going to pay next month's bills? So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financial planning. Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probably not affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered. So we're going to have to change our -- our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in. All right. Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg. </p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, you promised the American people that you won't just tell them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the government need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fund to really solve the credit crisis? </p><p>President Obama: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it's not over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing the TARP legislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistency in how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- in -- in how the money went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as we should have. My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That's my first job. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is to make sure that my secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a way that's transparent, in a way that provides clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to banks on them reducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and to make sure that they're not wasting that money. We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so that some trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is that nobody really knows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We've got to open things up and restore some trust. We also have to deal with the housing issue in a clear and consistent way.I don't want to preempt my secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's create a template in which we're restoring market confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we're going to need additional money or how much additional money we'll need until we've seen how successful we are at restoring a sense of confidence in a marketplace that the federal government and the Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.That can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into the marketplace. And ultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that has been withdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence, so that private capital goes back in.Okay. Jake. </p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. My question follows Julianna's in content. The American people have seen hundreds of billions of dollars spent already. And still the economy continues to free-fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, once all the legs of your stool are in place--</p><p>President Obama: Right. </p><p></p><p>Question: -- how can the American people gauge whether or not your programs are working? </p><p>Can they -- should they be looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment? What metric should they use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether or not we need to go to a Plan B? </p><p>President Obama: I think my initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom line number one, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidence to make purchases, to make investments. Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence. And they start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one, job creation. Step number two, are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard about today was the fact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan.Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, step number two. Step number three is going to be housing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the federal government doesn't have complete control over that. But if our plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we can start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a difficult year -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start making purchases again. And if we get things right then, starting next year, we can start seeing some significant improvement. Ed Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There he is. </p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. You've promised to send more troops to Afghanistan. And since you've been very clear about a time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months, I wonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventually from Afghanistan?</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.And related to that, there's a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins from coming into Dover Air Force Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that it was shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into the country under the cover of night. You've promised unprecedented transparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy, so the American people can see the full human cost of war? </p><p>President Obama: Your question is timely. We got reports that four American service members have been killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to the families. I've said before that, you know, people have asked me, \"When did it hit you that you are now president?\" And what I told them was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of our fallen heroes. It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carry in this office and the consequences of decisions that you make. Now with respect to the policy of opening up media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in the process of reviewing those policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. So I don't want to give you an answer now, before I've evaluated that review and understand all the implications involved.With respect to Afghanistan, this is going to be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary work done by our troops and some very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, we just saw an election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and you get a sense that the political system is now functioning in a meaningful way. You do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the national government seems very detached from what's going on in the surrounding community. In addition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And what we haven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safe havens that would ultimately make our mission successful. So we are undergoing a thorough-going review. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM, conducting his own review, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sent over -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluate a regional approach. We are going to need more effective coordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts with development efforts with more effective coordination with our allies in order for us to be successful. The bottom line, though -- and I just want to remember the American people, because this is going to be difficult -- is this is a situation in which a region served as the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past week I met with families of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs of allowing those safe havens to exist. My bottom line is that we cannot allow al Qaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in that region. And we're going to have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, in order to make sure that those safe havens don't exist. I do not have yet a timetable for how long that's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'm not going to allow al Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks on the U.S. homeland. All right.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.Helene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here you go. </p><p>Question: Thank you, sir.I wanted to ask you, on the next bank bailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financial institutions use this money to loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do you make the case to the American people that this bailout will work when the last one didn't? </p><p>President Obama: Again, Helene, I -- I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I want all of you to show up at his press conference as well. He's going to be terrific. But this relates to Jake's earlier question. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to the people who need it. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing to businesses, large and small? Is it flowing to consumers? Are they able to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth on Main Street? And the package that we've put together is designed to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to make sure that Tim gets his moment in the sun tomorrow, all right?Major Garrett. Where is Major? </p><p>Question: Mr. President, at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the following thing about a conversation the two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn't disclose. \"If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really make the tough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong.\" Since the vice president brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with that ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? </p><p></p><p>President Obama: You know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly. But let me try this out. I think what Joe may have been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe any numerical percentage to any of this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have, any single thing that we do is going to be part of the solution, not all of the solution. And as I said in my introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended it to work out. This is an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk to economists, there's some general sense of how we're going to move forward. There's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's a strong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but that there should be a range of approaches. But even if we do everything right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financial system and making sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to have to deal with housing. We're still going to have to make sure that we've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for the financial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referring to that, but I use that as a launching point to make a general point about these issues. </p><p>President Obama: I have no idea. I really don't. Michael Fletcher, The Washington Post. </p><p>Question: Yeah, thank you, sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used steroids as a member of the Texas Rangers? </p><p>President Obama: Yeah, I think it's depressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when it comes to Major League Baseball. And if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.And you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids.What I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated. All right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. I'm really excited. </p><p>Question: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons? </p><p>President Obama: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens. They're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men, women and children. And you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue. </p><p>Question: Did you get any promise from them? </p><p>President Obama: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat. With respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger. And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally. I think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in an effective way, so that -- </p><p>President Obama: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years. Okay. All right. Sam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam? </p><p>Question: Right here. </p><p></p><p>President Obama: There. Go ahead.</p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Today, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration. He said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administration officials? </p><p>President Obama: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven't seen. What I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary.My view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequate information.</p><p>The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around the nation.So I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right moving forward. Mara Liasson.</p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to pay more. What do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus led you to think about when you think about these future challenges?</p><p>President Obama: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it. And whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done. Now, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there. I mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There will continue to be consultation. One thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long. And let me give you a prime example. When it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility. </p><p>Having said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road.Both Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solve that problem. I think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards. So my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery package. And so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to be cleared up. But I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide. All right? </p><p>Staff: Thank you. </p><p></p><p>Question: One more, Mr. President. </p><p>President Obama: Thank you, guys.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Abraham Lincoln D.C. Bicentennial Celebration Speech", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Thank you. Please, be seated. Thank you very much.Madam Speaker, Leader Reid, members of Congress, dear friends, former colleagues:It is a great honor to be here -- a place where Lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where the nation he saved bid him a last farewell. As we mark the bicentennial of our 16th President's birth, I cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speaking today, but I can say that I feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible -- and in so many ways made America's story possible.It is fitting that we are holding this celebration here at the Capitol, for the life of this building is bound ever so closely to the times of this immortal President. Built by artisans and craftsmen, but also immigrants and slaves, it was here, in the rotunda, that Union soldiers received help from a makeshift hospital; it was downstairs, in the basement, that they were baked bread to give them strength; and it was in the Senate and House chambers where they slept at night and spent some of their days.What those soldiers saw when they looked on this building was a very different sight than the one we see today, for it remained unfinished until the end of the war. The laborers who built the dome came to work wondering each day whether that would be their last; whether the metal they were using for its frame would be requisitioned for the war and melted down into bullets. But each day went by without any orders to halt construction, and so they kept on working, and kept on building.And when President Lincoln was finally told of all the metal being used here, his response was short and clear: That is as it should be. The American people needed to be reminded, he believed, that even in a time of war, the work would go on; the people's business would continue; that even when the nation itself was in doubt, its future was being secured; and that on that distant day, when the guns fell silent, a national capitol would stand, with a statue of freedom at its peak, as a symbol of unity in a land still mending its divisions.It is this sense of unity, this ability to plan for a shared future even at a moment where our nation was torn apart, that I reflect on today. And while there are any number of moments that reveal that particular side of this extraordinary man, Abraham Lincoln -- that particular aspect of his leadership -- there's one that I'd like to share with you today.In the war's final weeks, aboard Grant's flagship, </p><p>The River Queen, President Lincoln was asked what was to be done with the rebel armies once General Lee surrendered. With victory at hand, Lincoln could have sought revenge. He could have forced the South to pay a steep price for their rebellion. But despite all the bloodshed and all the misery that each side had exacted upon the other, and despite his absolute certainty in the rightness of the cause of ending slavery, no Confederate soldier was to be punished, Lincoln ordered. They were to be treated, as he put it, \"liberally all round.\" What Lincoln wanted was for Confederate troops to go back home and return to work on their farms and in their shops. He was even willing, he said, to \"let them have their horses to plow and their guns to shoot crows with.\"That was the only way, Lincoln knew, to repair the rifts that had torn this country apart. It was the only way to begin the healing that our nation so desperately needed. What Lincoln never forgot, not even in the midst of civil war, was that despite all that divides us -- north and south, black and white -- we were, at heart, one nation and one people, sharing a bond as Americans that could bend but would not break.And so even as we meet here today, in a moment when we are far less divided than in Lincoln's day, but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time -- and debating them sometimes fiercely -- let us remember that we are doing so as servants of the same flag, as representatives of the same people, and as stakeholders in a common future. That is the most fitting tribute we can pay -- the most lasting monument we can build -- to that most remarkable of men, Abraham Lincoln.Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.050176, 38.8892686]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Crowne Plaza Hotel, Springfield, IL", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Lincoln Association 102nd Birthday Banquet Speech", "article": "<p></p><p>Thank you very much.

I'm here and he's there. But part of the reason that Dick Durbin has been such a great friend, not just to me but to the people of Illinois, is because his work always comes first, and he has been unbelievable in providing leadership in the Senate, through thick and through thin. I'm very, very grateful to him. He is one of my greatest friends, and I would not be standing here if it were not for Dick Durbin. So please give Dick Durbin a big round of applause.</p><p>So it is wonderful to be back in Springfield, the city where I got my start in elective office, where I served for nearly a decade. I see some of my colleagues, your Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, in the house. You've got some constitutional officers there. I think that's Alexi, your Treasurer, who's going to be playing basketball with me at some point -- Dan Hynes, Comptroller, and just an incredible supporter during this past race; and your new Senate President, John Cullerton, one of the sharpest legislators that we've ever had. Is the Speaker around? He's over there? Mr. Speaker, it's good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>So I've got a lot of friends here. I've got to stop there, otherwise I'm going to be using up all my time.</p><p>I served here for nearly a decade and, as has already been mentioned, this is where I </p><p>launched my candidacy for President two years ago this week -- on the steps -- on the steps of the Old State Capitol where Abraham Lincoln served and prepared for the presidency.</p><p>It was here, nearly 150 years ago, that the man whose life we are celebrating today, who you've been celebrating all week, bid farewell to this city that he had come to call his own. And as has already been mentioned, on a platform at a train station not far from where we're gathered, Lincoln turned to the crowd that had come to see him off and said, \"To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.\" And being here tonight, surrounded by all of you, I share his sentiment. But looking out at this room, full of so many who did so much for me, I'm also reminded of what Lincoln once said to a favor-seeker who claimed it was his efforts that made the difference in the election. Lincoln asked him, \"So you think you made me President?\" \"Yes,\" the man replied, \"under Providence, I think I did.\" \"Well,\" said Lincoln, \"it's a pretty mess you've got me into.\" \"But I forgive you.\"</p><p>So whoever of you think you are responsible for this -- we're taking names.</p><p>It's a humbling task, marking the bicentennial of our 16th President's birth -- humbling for me in particular because it's fair to say that the presidency of this singular figure who we celebrate in so many ways made my own story possible.</p><p>Here in Springfield, it's easier, though, to reflect on Lincoln the man rather than the marble giant -- before Gettysburg, before Antietam, before Fredericksburg and Bull Run, before emancipation was proclaimed and the captives were set free. In 1854, Lincoln was simply a Springfield lawyer who'd served just a single term in Congress. Possibly in his law office, his feet on a cluttered desk, his sons playing around him, his clothes a bit too small to fit his uncommon frame, maybe wondering if somebody might call him up and ask him to be Commerce Secretary -- he put some thoughts on paper, and for what purpose we do not know: \"The legitimate object of government,\" he wrote, \"is to do for the people what needs to be done, but which they cannot, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, by themselves.\"</p><p>To do for the people what needs to be done but which they cannot do on their own. It's a simple statement. But it answers a central question of Abraham Lincoln's life. Why did he land on the side of union? What was it that made him so unrelenting in pursuit of victory that he was willing to test the Constitution he ultimately preserved? What was it that led this man to give his last full measure of devotion so that our nation might endure?</p><p>These are not easy questions to answer, and I cannot know if I'm right. But I suspect that his devotion to the idea of union came not from a belief that government always had the answer. It came not from a failure to understand our individual rights and responsibilities. This rugged rail-splitter, born in a log cabin of pioneer stock; who cleared a path through the woods as a boy; who lost a mother and a sister to the rigors of frontier life; who taught himself all that he knew; and everything that he had was because of his hard work -- this man, our first Republican President, knew better than anybody what it meant to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. He understood that strain of personal liberty and self-reliance, that fierce independence at the heart of the American experience.</p><p>But he also understood something else. He recognized that while each of us must do our part, work as hard as we can, be as responsible as we can, although we are responsible for our own fates, in the end, there are certain things we cannot do on our own. There are certain things we can only do together. There are certain things only a union can do.</p><p>Only a union could harness the courage of our pioneers to settle the American West, which is why Lincoln passed a Homestead Act giving a tract of land to anyone seeking a stake in our growing economy.</p><p>Only a union could foster the ingenuity of our framers -- the ingenuity of our farmers, which is why he set up land-grant colleges that taught them how to make the most of their land while giving their children an education that let them dream the American Dream.</p><p>Only a union could speed our expansion and connect our coasts with a transcontinental railroad, and so, even in the midst of civil war, Lincoln built one. He fueled new enterprises with a national currency, spurred innovation, and ignited America's imagination with a national academy of sciences, believing we must, as he put it, add \"the fuel of interest to the fire of genius in the discovery \u00bc of new and useful things.\" And on this day, that is also the bicentennial of Charles Darwin's birth, it's worth a moment to pause and renew that commitment to science and innovation and discovery that Lincoln understood so well.</p><p>Only a union could serve the hopes of every citizen to knock down the barriers to opportunity and give each and every person the chance to pursue the American Dream. Lincoln understood what Washington understood when he led farmers and craftsmen and shopkeepers to rise up against an empire; what Roosevelt understood when he lifted us from Depression, built an arsenal of democracy, created the largest middle class in history with the GI bill. It's what Kennedy understood when he sent us to the moon.</p><p>All these Presidents recognized that America is -- and always has been -- more than a band of 13 colonies, or 50 states -- more than a bunch of Yankees and Confederates, more than a collection of Red States and Blue States. But we are the United States. There isn't any dream beyond our reach -- there is no dream beyond our reach, any obstacle that can stand in our way when we recognize that our individual liberty is served, not negated, by a recognition of the common good.</p><p>That is the spirit we are called to show once more. The challenges we face are very different now: two wars; an economic crisis unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. Jobs have been lost. Pensions are gone. Families' dreams have been endangered. Health care costs are exploding. Schools are falling short. We have an energy crisis that's hampering our economy and threatening our planet and enriching our adversaries.</p><p>And yet, while our challenges may be new, they did not come about overnight. Ultimately they result from a failure to meet the test that Lincoln set. I understand there have been times in our history when our government has misjudged what we can do by individual effort alone, and what we can only do together; when we didn't draw the line as effectively as we should have; when government has done things that people can -- and should -- do for themselves.</p><p>Our welfare system, before reform, too often dampened individual initiative, discouraging people from taking responsibility for their own upward mobility. In education, sometimes we've lost sight of the role of parents, rather than government, in cultivating a thirst for knowledge and instilling those qualities of good character, hard work and discipline and integrity -- that are so important to educational achievement and professional success.</p><p>But in recent years, we've seen the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction. What's dominated is a philosophy that says every problem can be solved if only government would step out of the way; that if government were just dismantled and divvied up into tax breaks, that it would somehow benefit us all. Such knee-jerk disdain for government -- this constant rejection of any common endeavor -- cannot rebuild our levees or our roads or our bridges. It can't refurbish our schools or modernize our health care system. It can't lead to the next medical discovery or yield the research and technology that will spark a clean energy economy.</p><p>Only a nation can do those things. Only by coming together, all of us, in union, and expressing that sense of shared sacrifice and responsibility -- for ourselves, yes, but also for one another -- can we do the work that must be done in this country. That is -- that is part of the definition of being American.</p><p>It's only by rebuilding our economy and fostering the conditions of growth that willing workers can find a job, and companies can find capital, and the entrepreneurial spirit that is the key to our competitiveness can flourish. It's only by unleashing the potential of alternative fuels that will lower our energy bills and raise our industries' sights, make our nation safer and our planet cleaner. It's only by remaking our schools for the 21st century that our children will get those good jobs so they can make of their lives what they will. It's only by coming together to do what people need done that we will, in Lincoln's words, \"lift artificial weights from all shoulders [and give] an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life.\" That's all people are looking for, fair chance in the race of life.</p><p>That's what's required of us -- now and in the years ahead. We will be remembered for what we choose to make of this moment. And when posterity looks back on our time, as we are looking back on Lincoln's, I don't want it said that we saw an economic crisis but did not stem it; that we saw our schools decline and our bridges crumble but we did not rebuild them; that the world changed in the 21st century but America did not lead it; that we were consumed with small things, petty things, when we were called to do great things. Instead, let them say that this generation -- our generation -- of Americans rose to the moment and gave America a new birth of freedom and opportunity in our time.</p><p>These are trying days and they will grow tougher in the months to come. And there will be moments when our doubts rise and our hopes recede. But let's always remember that we, as a people, have been here before. There were times when our revolution itself seemed altogether improbable, when the union was all but lost, when fascism seemed set to prevail around the world. And yet, what earlier generations discovered -- and what we must rediscover right now -- is that it is precisely when we are in the deepest valley, when the climb is steepest, that Americans relearn how to takethe mountaintop. Together. As one nation. As one people. As one nation. As one people.</p><p>That's how we will beat back our present dangers. That is how we will surpass what trials may come. That's how we will do what Lincoln called on us all to do, and \"nobly save \u00bc the last best hope on earth.\" That's what this is, the last best hope on earth. Lincoln has passed that legacy onto us. It is now our responsibility to pass it on to the next generation.</p><p>Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-89.6058931, 39.7641415]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Camp Lejeune, North Carolina", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Ending the Iraq War at Camp Lejeune Speech", "article": "<p>[as prepared for delivery]Thank you very much.

Thank you for that outstanding welcome. I want to thank Lieutenant General Hejlik for hosting me here today.I also want to acknowledge all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. That includes the Camp Lejeune Marines now serving with \u0096 or soon joining \u0096 the Second Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq; those with Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force in Afghanistan; and those among the 8,000 Marines who are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. We have you in our prayers. We pay tribute to your service. We thank you and your families for all that you do for America. And I want all of you to know that there is no higher honor or greater responsibility than serving as your Commander-in-Chief.I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Ryan Crocker, who recently completed his service as our Ambassador to Iraq. Throughout his career, Ryan always took on the toughest assignments. He is an example of the very best that this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He carried on his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two of our finest Generals \u0096 General David Petraeus, and General Ray Odierno \u0096 who will be critical in carrying forward the strategy that I will outline today.Next month will mark the sixth anniversary of the war in Iraq. By any measure, this has already been a long war. For the men and women of America\u0092s armed forces \u0096 and for your families \u0096 this war has been one of the most extraordinary chapters of service in the history of our nation. You have endured tour after tour after tour of duty. You have known the dangers of combat and the lonely distance of loved ones. You have fought against tyranny and disorder. You have bled for your best friends and for unknown Iraqis. And you have borne an enormous burden for your fellow citizens, while extending a precious opportunity to the people of Iraq. Under tough circumstances, the men and women of the United States military have served with honor, and succeeded beyond any expectation. \u00a0Today, I have come to speak to you about how the war in Iraq will end.To understand where we need to go in Iraq, it is important for the American people to understand where we now stand. Thanks in great measure to your service, the situation in Iraq has improved. Violence has been reduced substantially from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been dealt a serious blow by our troops and Iraq\u0092s Security Forces, and through our partnership with Sunni Arabs. The capacity of Iraq\u0092s Security Forces has improved, and Iraq\u0092s leaders have taken steps toward political accommodation. The relative peace and strong participation in January\u0092s provincial elections sent a powerful message to the world about how far Iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through a peaceful political process.\u00a0But let there be no doubt: Iraq is not yet secure, and there will be difficult days ahead. Violence will continue to be a part of life in Iraq. Too many fundamental political questions about Iraq\u0092s future remain unresolved. Too many Iraqis are still displaced or destitute. Declining oil revenues will put an added strain on a government that has had difficulty delivering basic services. Not all of Iraq\u0092s neighbors are contributing to its security. Some are working at times to undermine it. And even as Iraq\u0092s government is on a surer footing, it is not yet a full partner \u0096 politically and economically \u0096 in the region, or with the international communityIn short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in Iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation.On my first full day in office, I directed my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of our strategy in Iraq to determine the best way to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening American national security. I have listened to my Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and commanders on the ground. We have acted with careful consideration of events on the ground; with respect for the security agreements between the United States and Iraq; and with a critical recognition that the long-term solution in Iraq must be political \u0096 not military. Because the most important decisions that have to be made about Iraq\u0092s future must now be made by Iraqis.We have also taken into account the simple reality that America can no longer afford to see Iraq in isolation from other priorities: we face the challenge of refocusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan; of relieving the burden on our military; and of rebuilding our struggling economy \u0096 and these are challenges that we will meet.Today, I can announce that our review is complete, and that the United States will pursue a new strategy to end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility.This strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the American people: an Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant. To achieve that goal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, representative, and accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe-haven to terrorists. We will help Iraq build new ties of trade and commerce with the world. And we will forge a partnership with the people and government of Iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region.What we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals. We cannot rid Iraq of all who oppose America or sympathize with our adversaries. We cannot police Iraq\u0092s streets until they are completely safe, nor stay until Iraq\u0092s union is perfected. We cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that has put a strain on our military, and will cost the American people nearly a trillion dollars. America\u0092s men and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the Iraqis this chance to choose a better future. Now, we must ask the Iraqi people to seize it. \u00a0The first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from Iraq.</p><p> As a candidate for President, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we\u0092ve made and protect our troops. Those consultations are now complete, and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.As we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians in Iraq. We will proceed carefully, and I will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and with the Iraqi government. There will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments. But our enemies should be left with no doubt: this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to support our Iraqi partners, and to succeed.After we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the Iraqi government and its Security Forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country. As I have long said, we will retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq. Initially, this force will likely be made up of 35-50,000 U.S. troops.Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments. And under the Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. We will complete this transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that they have earned.As we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part of our strategy: sustained diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq.The drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that Iraq\u0092s future is now its own responsibility. The long-term success of the Iraqi nation will depend upon decisions made by Iraq\u0092s leaders and the fortitude of the Iraqi people. Iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; America cannot \u0096 and should not \u0096 take their place. However, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progress and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.This effort will be led by our new Ambassador to Iraq \u0096 Chris Hill. From his time in the Peace Corps, to his work in Kosovo and Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, and he has shown the pragmatism and skill that we need right now. He will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many American diplomats and aid workers who are serving in Iraq.Going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts. We will work with the United Nations to support national elections, while helping Iraqis improve local government. We can serve as an honest broker in pursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided Iraq\u0092s leaders. And just as we will support Iraq\u0092s Security Forces, we will help Iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, confront corruption, and deliver basic services.Diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced Iraqis. These men, women and children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they must become a part of Iraq\u0092s reconciliation and recovery. America has a strategic interest \u0096 and a moral responsibility \u0096 to act. In the coming months, my administration will provide more assistance and take steps to increase international support for countries already hosting refugees; we\u0092ll cooperate with others to resettle Iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work with the Iraqi government over time to resettle refugees and displaced Iraqis within Iraq \u0096 because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace than displaced citizens returning home.Now, before I go any further, I want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of Iraq.You are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization. You are joined together by enduring accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land. In years past, you have persevered through tyranny and terror; through personal insecurity and sectarian violence. And instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, and showed a proud resilience that deserves respect.Our nations have known difficult times together. But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, and countless friendships among our people. We Americans have offered our most precious resource -- our young men and women -- to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out our common enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours.There are those who will try to prevent that future for Iraq \u0096 who will insist that Iraq\u0092s differences cannot be reconciled without more killing. They represent the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, and they will test our will in the months and years to come. America, too, has known these forces. We endured the pain of Civil War, and bitter divisions of region and race. But hostility and hatred are no match for justice; they offer no pathway to peace; and they must not stand between the people of Iraq and a future of reconciliation and hope.So to the Iraqi people, let me be clear about America\u0092s intentions. The United States pursues no claim on your territory or your resources. We respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country. We seek a full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your country. And going forward, we can build a lasting relationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as Iraq takes its rightful place in the community of nations.That leads me to the third part of our strategy -- comprehensive American engagement across the region.The future of Iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader Middle East, so we must work with our friends and partners to establish a new framework that advances Iraq\u0092s security and the region\u0092s. It is time for Iraq to be a full partner in a regional dialogue, and for Iraq\u0092s neighbors to establish productive and normalized relations with Iraq. And going forward, the United States will pursue principled and sustained engagement with all of the nations in the region, and that will include Iran and Syria.This reflects a fundamental truth: we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation \u0096 we need a smarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach. That is why we are renewing our diplomacy, while relieving the burden on our military. That is why we are refocusing on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan; developing a strategy to use all elements of American power to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; and actively seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world. \u00a0And that is why we have named three of America\u0092s most accomplished diplomats \u0096 George Mitchell, Dennis Ross and Richard Holbrooke \u0096 to support Secretary Clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda.\u00a0Every nation and every group must know -- whether you wish America good or ill -- that the end of the war in Iraq will enable a new era of American leadership and engagement in the Middle East. And that era has just begun.Finally, I want to be very clear that my strategy for ending the war in Iraq does not end with military plans or diplomatic agendas \u0096 it endures through our commitment to uphold our sacred trust with every man and woman who has served in Iraq.</p><p> You make up a fraction of the American population, but in an age when so many people and institutions have acted irresponsibly, you did the opposite \u0096 you volunteered to bear the heaviest burden. And for you and for your families, the war does not end when you come home. It lives on in memories of your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who gave their lives. It endures in the wound that is slow to heal, the disability that isn\u0092t going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or the stiffening in your spine when a car backfires down the street.\u00a0You and your families have done your duty \u0096 now a grateful nation must do ours. That is why I am increasing the number of soldiers and Marines, so that we lessen the burden on those who are serving. And that is why I have committed to expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and to provide better care in more places. We will continue building new wounded warrior facilities across America, and invest in new ways of identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury, as well as other combat injuries.We also know that service does not end with the person wearing the uniform. In her visits with military families across the country, my wife Michelle has learned firsthand about the unique burden that your families endure every day. I want you to know this: military families are a top priority for Michelle and me, and they will be a top priority for my administration. We\u0092ll raise military pay, and continue providing quality child-care, job-training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have known the separation and stress of war. We will also heed the lesson of history \u0096 that those who fight in battle can form the backbone of our middle class \u0096 by implementing a 21st century GI Bill to help our veterans live their dreams.As a nation, we have had our share of debates about the war in Iraq. It has, at times, divided us as a people. To this very day, there are some Americans who want to stay in Iraq longer, and some who want to leave faster. But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.And so I want to be very clear: We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein\u0092s regime \u0096 and you got the job done. We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government \u0096 and you got the job done. And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life \u0096 that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible.There are many lessons to be learned from what we\u0092ve experienced. We have learned that America must go to war with clearly defined goals, which is why I\u0092ve ordered a review of our policy in Afghanistan. We have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the American people, which is why I\u0092ve put Iraq and Afghanistan into my budget. We have learned that in the 21st century, we must use all elements of American power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with Congress and in carrying out my plans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the world.The starting point for our policies must always be the safety of the American people. I know that you \u0096 the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world \u0096 can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe. And as long as I am your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harm\u0092s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is the most important lesson of all \u0096 for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. \u00a0You know because you have seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them.</p><p>\"Semper Fidelis\" \u0096 it means always being faithful to Corps, and to country, and to the memory of fallen comrades like Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter. These young men enlisted in a time of war, knowing they would face great danger. They came here, to Camp Lejeune, as they trained for their mission. And last April, they were standing guard in Anbar. In an age when suicide is a weapon, they were suddenly faced with an oncoming truck filled with explosives. These two Marines stood their ground. These two Marines opened fire. And these two Marines stopped that truck. When the thousands of pounds of explosives detonated, they had saved fifty Marines and Iraqi police who would have been in the truck\u0092s path, but Corporal Yale and Lance Corporal Haerter lost their own lives. Jonathan was 21. Jordan was 19.In the town where Jordan Haerter was from, a bridge was dedicated in his name. One Marine who traveled to the ceremony said: \"We flew here from all over the country to pay tribute to our friend Jordan, who risked his life to save us. We wouldn\u0092t be here without him.\"America\u0092s time in Iraq is filled with stories of men and women like this. Their names are written into bridges and town squares. They are etched into stones at Arlington, and in quiet places of rest across our land. They are spoken in schools and on city blocks. They live on in the memories of those who wear your uniform, in the hearts of those they loved, and in the freedom of the nation they served.Each American who has served in Iraq has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that story is now a part of the history of the United States of America \u0096 a nation that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches of Normandy to the deserts of Anbar; from the mountains of Korea to the streets of Kandahar. You teach us that the price of freedom is great. Your sacrifice should challenge all of us \u0096 every single American \u0096 to ask what we can do to be better citizens.There will be more danger in the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we are leaving Iraq to its people, and we have begun the work of ending this war.\u00a0Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.

Thank you for the wonderful introduction, David. And thank you for the great work that you are doing each and every day. And I appreciate such a warm welcome. Some of you I've gotten a chance to know; many of you I'm meeting for the first time. But the spirit of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the desire to create jobs and provide opportunity to people who sometimes have been left out -- that's exactly what this administration is about. That's the essence of the American Dream. And so I'm very proud to have a chance to speak with all of you.You know, every so often, throughout our history, a generation of Americans bears the responsibility of seeing this country through difficult times and protecting the dream of its founding for posterity. This is a responsibility that's fallen to our generation. Meeting it will require steering our nation's economy through a crisis unlike anything that we have seen in our time.  In the short term, that means jump-starting job creation and restarting lending, and restoring confidence in our markets and our financial system. But it also means taking steps that not only advance our recovery, but lay the foundation for lasting, shared prosperity.  I know there's some who believe we can only handle one challenge at a time. And they forget that Lincoln helped lay down the transcontinental railroad and passed the Homestead Act and created the National Academy of Sciences in the midst of civil war. Likewise, President Roosevelt didn't have the luxury of choosing between ending a depression and fighting a war; he had to do both. President Kennedy didn't have the luxury of choosing between civil rights and sending us to the moon. And we don't have the luxury of choosing between getting our economy moving now and rebuilding it over the long term.America will not remain true to its highest ideals -- and America's place as a global economic leader will be put at risk -- unless we not only bring down the crushing cost of health care and transform the way we use energy, but also if we do -- if we don't do a far better job than we've been doing of educating our sons and daughters; unless we give them the knowledge and skills they need in this new and changing world.For we know that economic progress and educational achievement have always gone hand in hand in America. The land-grant colleges and public high schools transformed the economy of an industrializing nation. The GI Bill generated a middle class that made America's economy unrivaled in the 20th century. Investments in math and science under President Eisenhower gave new opportunities to young scientists and engineers all across the country. It made possible somebody like a Sergei Brin to attend graduate school and found an upstart company called Google that would forever change our world.The source of America's prosperity has never been merely how ably we accumulate wealth, but how well we educate our people. This has never been more true than it is today. In a 21st-century world where jobs can be shipped wherever there's an Internet connection, where a child born in Dallas is now competing with a child in New Delhi, where your best job qualification is not what you do, but what you know -- education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity and success, it's a prerequisite for success.  That's why workers without a four-year degree have borne the brunt of recent layoffs, Latinos most of all. That's why, of the 30 fastest growing occupations in America, half require a Bachelor's degree or more. By 2016, four out of every 10 new jobs will require at least some advanced education or training.  So let there be no doubt: The future belongs to the nation that best educates its citizens -- and my fellow Americans, we have everything we need to be that nation. We have the best universities, the most renowned scholars. We have innovative principals and passionate teachers and gifted students, and we have parents whose only priority is their child's education. We have a legacy of excellence, and an unwavering belief that our children should climb higher than we did.  And yet, despite resources that are unmatched anywhere in the world, we've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us. Let me give you a few statistics. In 8th grade math, we've fallen to 9th place. Singapore's middle-schoolers outperform ours three to one. Just a third of our 13- and 14-year-olds can read as well as they should. And year after year, a stubborn gap persists between how well white students are doing compared to their African American and Latino classmates. The relative decline of American education is untenable for our economy, it's unsustainable for our democracy, it's unacceptable for our children -- and we can't afford to let it continue.What's at stake is nothing less than the American Dream. It's what drew my father and so many of your fathers and mothers to our shores in pursuit of an education. It's what led Linda Brown and Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez to bear the standard of all who were attending separate and unequal schools. It's what has led generations of Americans to take on that extra job, to sacrifice the small pleasures, to scrimp and save wherever they can, in hopes of putting away enough, just enough, to give their child the education that they never had. It's that most American of ideas, that with the right education, a child of any race, any faith, any station, can overcome whatever barriers stand in their way and fulfill their God-given potential.Of course, we've heard all this year after year after year after year -- and far too little has changed. Certainly it hasn't changed in too many overcrowded Latino schools; it hasn't changed in too many inner-city schools that are seeing dropout rates of over 50 percent. It's not changing not because we're lacking sound ideas or sensible plans -- in pockets of excellence across this country, we're seeing what children from all walks of life can and will achieve when we set high standards, have high expectations, when we do a good job of preparing them. Instead, it's because politics and ideology have too often trumped our progress that we're in the situation that we're in.  For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same stale debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom. Too many in the Republican Party have opposed new investments in early education, despite compelling evidence of its importance. So what we get here in Washington is the same old debate about it's more money versus more reform, vouchers versus the status quo. There's been partisanship and petty bickering, but little recognition that we need to move beyond the worn fights of the 20th century if we're going to succeed in the 21st century.I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us -- holding ourselves accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, but new reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding good teachers, stop making excuses for bad ones. It's time to demand results from government at every level. It's time to prepare every child, everywhere in America, to out-compete any worker, anywhere in the world. It's time to give all Americans a complete and competitive education from the cradle up through a career. We've accepted failure for far too long. Enough is enough. America's entire education system must once more be the envy of the world -- and that's exactly what we intend to do.That's exactly what the budget I'm submitting to Congress has begun to achieve. Now, at a time when we've inherited a trillion-dollar deficit, we will start by doing a little housekeeping, going through our books, cutting wasteful education programs. My outstanding Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who's here today -- stand up, Arne, so everybody can see you. I'm assuming you also saw my Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. But Secretary Duncan will use only one test when deciding what ideas to support with your precious tax dollars: It's not whether an idea is liberal or conservative, but whether it works. And this will help free up resources for the first pillar of reforming our schools -- investing in early childhood initiatives.This isn't just about keeping an eye on our children, it's about educating them. Studies show that children in early childhood education programs are more likely to score higher in reading and math, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, more likely to hold a job, and more likely to earn more in that job. For every dollar we invest in these programs, we get nearly $10 back in reduced welfare rolls, fewer health care costs, and less crime. That's why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that I signed into law invests $5 billion in growing Early Head Start and Head Start, expanding access to quality child care for 150,000 more children from working families, and doing more for children with special needs. And that's why we are going to offer 55,000 first-time parents regular visits from trained nurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and for life.Even as we invest in early childhood education, let's raise the bar for early learning programs that are falling short. Now, today, some children are enrolled in excellent programs. Some children are enrolled in mediocre programs. And some are wasting away their most formative years in bad programs. That includes the one-fourth of all children who are Hispanic, and who will drive America's workforce of tomorrow, but who are less likely to have been enrolled in an early childhood education program than anyone else.That's why I'm issuing a challenge to our states: Develop a cutting-edge plan to raise the quality of your early learning programs; show us how you'll work to ensure that children are better prepared for success by the time they enter kindergarten. If you do, we will support you with an Early Learning Challenge Grant that I call on Congress to enact. That's how we will reward quality and incentivize excellence, and make a down payment on the success of the next generation.So that's the first pillar of our education reform agenda. The second, we will end what has become a race to the bottom in our schools and instead spur a race to the top by encouraging better standards and assessments. Now, this is an area where we are being outpaced by other nations. It's not that their kids are any smarter than ours -- it's that they are being smarter about how to educate their children. They're spending less time teaching things that don't matter, and more time teaching things that do. They're preparing their students not only for high school or college, but for a career. We are not. Our curriculum for 8th graders is two full years behind top performing countries. That's a prescription for economic decline. And I refuse to accept that America's children cannot rise to this challenge. They can, and they must, and they will meet higher standards in our time. So let's challenge our states -- let's challenge our states to adopt world-class standards that will bring our curriculums to the 21st century. Today's system of 50 different sets of benchmarks for academic success means 4th grade readers in Mississippi are scoring nearly 70 points lower than students in Wyoming -- and they're getting the same grade. Eight of our states are setting their standards so low that their students may end up on par with roughly the bottom 40 percent of the world.That's inexcusable. That's why I'm calling on states that are setting their standards far below where they ought to be to stop low-balling expectations for our kids. The solution to low test scores is not lowering standards -- it's tougher, clearer standards.\u00a0 Standards like those in Massachusetts, where 8th graders are -- we have a Massachusetts contingent here. In Massachusetts, 8th graders are now tying for first -- first in the whole world in science. Other forward-thinking states are moving in the same direction by coming together as part of a consortium. And more states need to do the same. And I'm calling on our nation's governors and state education chiefs to develop standards and assessments that don't simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble on a test, but whether they possess 21st century skills like problem-solving and critical thinking and entrepreneurship and creativity.  That is what we'll help them do later this year -- that what we're going to help them do later this year when we finally make No Child Left Behind live up to its name by ensuring not only that teachers and principals get the funding that they need, but that the money is tied to results.\u00a0 And Arne Duncan will also back up this commitment to higher standards with a fund to invest in innovation in our school districts.Of course, raising standards alone will not make much of a difference unless we provide teachers and principals with the information they need to make sure students are prepared to meet those standards. And far too few states have data systems like the one in Florida that keep track of a student's education from childhood through college. And far too few districts are emulating the example of Houston and Long Beach, and using data to track how much progress a student is making and where that student is struggling. That's a resource that can help us improve student achievement, and tell us which students had which teachers so we can assess what's working and what's not. That's why we're making a major investment in this area that we will cultivate a new culture of accountability in America's schools.  Now, to complete our race to the top requires the third pillar of reform -- recruiting, preparing, and rewarding outstanding teachers. From the moment students enter a school, the most important factor in their success is not the color of their skin or the income of their parents, it's the person standing at the front of the classroom. That's why our Recovery Act will ensure that hundreds of thousands of teachers and school personnel are not laid off -- because those Americans are not only doing jobs they can't afford to lose, they're rendering a service our nation cannot afford to lose, either.  America's future depends on its teachers. And so today, I'm calling on a new generation of Americans to step forward and serve our country in our classrooms. If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation, if you want to make the most of your talents and dedication, if you want to make your mark with a legacy that will endure -- then join the teaching profession. America needs you. We need you in our suburbs. We need you in our small towns. We especially need you in our inner cities. We need you in classrooms all across our country.And if you do your part, then we'll do ours. That's why we're taking steps to prepare teachers for their difficult responsibilities, and encourage them to stay in the profession. That's why we're creating new pathways to teaching and new incentives to bring teachers to schools where they're needed most. That's why we support offering extra pay to Americans who teach math and science to end a teacher shortage in those subjects. It's why we're building on the promising work being done in places like South Carolina's Teachers Advancement Program, and making an unprecedented commitment to ensure that anyone entrusted with educating our children is doing the job as well as it can be done.  Now, here's what that commitment means: It means treating teachers like the professionals they are while also holding them more accountable -\u0096 in up to 150 more school districts. New teachers will be mentored by experienced ones. Good teachers will be rewarded with more money for improved student achievement, and asked to accept more responsibilities for lifting up their schools. Teachers throughout a school will benefit from guidance and support to help them improve.  And just as we've given our teachers all the support they need to be successful, we need to make sure our students have the teacher they need to be successful. And that means states and school districts taking steps to move bad teachers out of the classroom. But let me be clear -- Let me be clear -- the overwhelming number of teachers are doing an outstanding job under difficult circumstances. My sister is a teacher, so I know how tough teaching can be. But let me be clear: If a teacher is given a chance or two chances or three chances but still does not improve, there's no excuse for that person to continue teaching. I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences. The stakes are too high. We can afford nothing but the best when it comes to our children's teachers and the schools where they teach.  Now, that leads me to the fourth part of America's education strategy \u0096- promoting innovation and excellence in America's schools. One of the places where much of that innovation occurs is in our most effective charter schools. And these are public schools founded by parents, teachers, and civic or community organizations with broad leeway to innovate -\u0096 schools I supported as a state legislator and a United States senator.  But right now, there are many caps on how many charter schools are allowed in some states, no matter how well they're preparing our students. That isn't good for our children, our economy, or our country. Of course, any expansion of charter schools must not result in the spread of mediocrity, but in the advancement of excellence. And that will require states adopting both a rigorous selection and review process to ensure that a charter school's autonomy is coupled with greater accountability \u0096- as well as a strategy, like the one in Chicago, to close charter schools that are not working. Provided this greater accountability, I call on states to reform their charter rules, and lift caps on the number of allowable charter schools, wherever such caps are in place.Now, even as we foster innovation in where our children are learning, let's also foster innovation in when our children are learning. We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed for when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day. That calendar may have once made sense, but today it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children -- listen to this -- our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea -- every year. That's no way to prepare them for a 21st century economy. That's why I'm calling for us not only to expand effective after-school programs, but to rethink the school day to incorporate more time -\u0096 whether during the summer or through expanded-day programs for children who need it.Now, I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas.\u00a0 Not with Malia and Sasha -- not in my family, and probably not in yours. But the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom. If they can do that in South Korea, we can do it right here in the United States of America.Of course, no matter how innovative our schools or how effective our teachers, America cannot succeed unless our students take responsibility for their own education. That means showing up for school on time, paying attention in class, seeking out extra tutoring if it's needed, staying out of trouble. To any student who's watching, I say this: Don't even think about dropping out of school. Don't even think about it. As I said a couple of weeks ago, dropping out is quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and it's not an option -- not anymore. Not when our high school dropout rate has tripled in the past 30 years. Not when high school dropouts earn about half as much as college graduates. Not when Latino students are dropping out faster than just about anyone else. It's time for all of us, no matter what our backgrounds, to come together and solve this epidemic.Stemming the tide of dropouts will require turning around our low-performing schools. Just 2,000 high schools in cities like Detroit and Los Angeles and Philadelphia produce over 50 percent of America's dropouts. And yet there are too few proven strategies to transform these schools. And there are too few partners to get the job done.  So today, I'm issuing a challenge to educators and lawmakers, parents and teachers alike: Let us all make turning around our schools our collective responsibility as Americans. And that will require new investments in innovative ideas -- that's why my budget invests in developing new strategies to make sure at-risk students don't give up on their education; new efforts to give dropouts who want to return to school the help they need to graduate; and new ways to put those young men and women who have left school back on a pathway to graduation.  Now, the fifth part of America's education strategy is providing every American with a quality higher education -\u0096 whether it's college or technical training. Never has a college degree been more important. Never has it been more expensive. And at a time when so many of our families are bearing enormous economic burdens, the rising cost of tuition threatens to shatter dreams. And that's why we will simplify federal college assistance forms so it doesn't take a Ph.D to apply for financial aid.  That's why we're already taking steps to make college or technical training affordable. For the first time ever, Pell Grants will not be subject to the politics of the moment or the whim of the market \u0096- they will be a commitment that Congress is required to uphold each and every year. Not only that; because rising costs mean Pell Grants cover less than half as much tuition as they did 30 years ago, we're raising the maximum Pell Grant to $5,550 a year and indexing it above inflation. We're also providing a $2,500-a-year tuition tax credit for students from working families. And we're modernizing and expanding the Perkins Loan Program to make sure schools like UNLV don't get a tenth as many Perkins loans as schools like Harvard.  To help pay for all of this, we're putting students ahead of lenders by eliminating wasteful student loan subsidies that cost taxpayers billions each year. All in all, we are making college affordable for 7 million more students with a sweeping investment in our children's futures and America's success. And I call on Congress to join me and the American people by making these investments possible. This is how we will help meet our responsibility as a nation to open the doors of college to every American. But it will also be the responsibility of colleges and universities to control spiraling costs. We can't just keep on putting more money in and universities and colleges not doing their part to hold down tuitions. And it's the responsibility of our students to walk through the doors of opportunity.</p><p>In just a single generation, America has fallen from 2nd place to 11th place in the portion of students completing college. That is unfortunate, but it's by no means irreversible. With resolve and the right investments, we can retake the lead once more. And that's why, in my address to the nation the other week, I called on Americans to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, with the goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the year 2020. And to meet that goal, we are investing $2.5 billion to identify and support innovative initiatives across the country that achieve results in helping students persist and graduate.So let's not stop at education with college. Let's recognize a 21st century reality: Learning doesn't end in our early 20s. Adults of all ages need opportunities to earn new degrees and new skills -- especially in the current economic environment. That means working with all our universities and schools, including community colleges -- a great and undervalued asset -- to prepare workers for good jobs in high-growth industries; and to improve access to job training not only for young people who are just starting their careers, but for older workers who need new skills to change careers. And that's going to be one of the key tasks that Secretary Solis is involved with, is making sure that lifelong learning is a reality and a possibility for more Americans.It's through initiatives like these that we'll see more Americans earn a college degree, or receive advanced training, and pursue a successful career. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to work with me to enact these essential reforms, and to reauthorize the Workforce Reinvestment Act. That's how we will round out a complete and competitive education in the United States of America.So here's the bottom line: Yes, we need more money; yes, we need more reform; yes, we need to hold ourselves more accountable for every dollar we spend. But there's one more ingredient I want to talk about. No government policy will make any difference unless we also hold ourselves more accountable as parents -- because government, no matter how wise or efficient, cannot turn off the TV or put away the video games. Teachers, no matter how dedicated or effective, cannot make sure your child leaves for school on time and does their homework when they get back at night. These are things only a parent can do. These are things that our parents must do.I say this not only as a father, but also as a son. When I was a child my mother and I lived overseas, and she didn't have the money to send me to the fancy international school where all the American kids went to school. So what she did was she supplemented my schooling with lessons from a correspondence course. And I can still picture her waking me up at 4:30 a.m., five days a week, to go over some lessons before I went to school. And whenever I'd complain and grumble and find some excuse and say, \"Awww, I'm sleepy,\" she'd patiently repeat to me her most powerful defense. She'd say, \"This is no picnic for me either, buster.\"And when you're a kid you don't think about the sacrifices they're making. She had to work; I just had to go to school. But she'd still wake up every day to make sure I was getting what I needed for my education. And it's because she did this day after day, week after week, because of all the other opportunities and breaks that I got along the way, all the sacrifices that my grandmother and my grandfather made along the way, that I can stand here today as President of the United States. It's because of the sacrifices -- See, I want every child in this country to have the same chance that my mother gave me, that my teachers gave me, that my college professors gave me, that America gave me.You know these stories; you've lived them, as well. All of you have a similar story to tell. You know, it's -- I want children like Yvonne Bojorquez to have that chance. Yvonne is a student at Village Academy High School in California. Now, Village Academy is a 21st century school where cutting edge technologies are used in the classroom, where college prep and career training are offered to all who seek it, and where the motto is \"respect, responsibility, and results.\"Now, a couple of months ago, Yvonne and her class made a video talking about the impact that our struggling economy was having on their lives. And some of them spoke about their parents being laid off, or their homes facing foreclosure, or their inability to focus on school with everything that was happening at home. And when it was her turn to speak, Yvonne said: \"We've all been affected by this economic crisis. [We] are all college bound students; we're all businessmen, and doctors and lawyers and all this great stuff. And we have all this potential -- but the way things are going, we're not going to be able to [fulfill it].\"It was heartbreaking that a girl so full of promise was so full of worry that she and her class titled their video, \"Is anybody listening?\" So, today, there's something I want to say to Yvonne and her class at Village Academy: I am listening. We are listening. America is listening. And we will not rest until your parents can keep your jobs -- we will not rest until your parents can keep their jobs and your families can keep their homes, and you can focus on what you should be focusing on -- your own education; until you can become the businessmen, doctors, and lawyers of tomorrow, until you can reach out and grasp your dreams for the future.For in the end, Yvonne's dream is a dream shared by all Americans. It's the founding promise of our nation: That we can make of our lives what we will; that all things are possible for all people; and that here in America, our best days lie ahead. I believe that. I truly believe if I do my part, and you, the American people, do yours, then we will emerge from this crisis a stronger nation, and pass the dream of our founding on to posterity, ever safer than before.Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Excel Center, London, England", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "G-20 London Economic Summit Press Conference", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Good afternoon, or good evening -- we're running a little bit late.Earlier today, we finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery. By any measure, the London summit was historic.\u00a0 It was historic because of the size and the scope of the challenges that we face, and because of the timeliness and magnitude of our response. The challenge is clear.\u00a0 The global economy is contracting. Trade is shrinking.\u00a0 Unemployment is rising.\u00a0 The international finance system is nearly frozen.\u00a0 Even these facts can't fully capture the crisis that we're confronting, because behind them is the pain and uncertainty that so many people are facing.\u00a0 We see it back in the United States.\u00a0 We see it here in London.\u00a0 We see it around the world:\u00a0 families losing their homes, workers losing their jobs and their savings, students who are deferring their dreams.\u00a0 So many have lost so much.\u00a0 Just to underscore this point, back in the United States, jobless claims released today were the highest in 26 years.\u00a0 We owe it to all of our citizens to act, and to act with a sense of urgency.In an age where our economies are linked more closely than ever before, the whole world has been touched by this devastating downturn.\u00a0 And today, the world's leaders have responded with an unprecedented set of comprehensive and coordinated actions.Now, just keep in mind some historical context.\u00a0 Faced with similar global challenges in the past, the world was slow to act, and people paid an enormous price.\u00a0 That was true in the Great Depression, when nations prolonged and worsened the crisis by turning inward, waiting for more than a decade to meet the challenge together.\u00a0 Even as recently as the 1980s, the slow global response deepened and widened a debt crisis in Latin America that pushed millions into poverty. Today, we've learned the lessons of history.\u00a0 I know that in the days leading up to the summit, some of you in the press, some commentators, confused honest and open debate with irreconcilable differences.\u00a0 But after weeks of preparation, and two days of careful negotiation, we have agreed on a series of unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this from happening again.Let me outline what I think has been most significant.Number one, we are committed to growth and job creation.\u00a0 All G20 nations have acted to stimulate demand, which will total well over $2 trillion in global fiscal expansion.\u00a0 The United States is also partnering with the private sector to clean out the troubled assets, the legacy assets that are crippling some banks, and using the full force of the government to ensure that our action leads directly to loans to businesses large and small, as well as individuals who depend on credit.\u00a0 And these efforts will be amplified by our G20 partners, who are pursuing similarly comprehensive programs.And we also agreed on bold action to support developing countries, so that we aren't faced with declining markets that the global economy depends on.\u00a0 Together, the G20 is tripling the IMF's lending capacity and promoting lending by multilateral development banks to increase the purchasing power and expand markets in every country.We've also rejected the protectionism that could deepen this crisis.\u00a0 History tells us that turning inward can help turn a downturn into a depression.\u00a0 And this cooperation between the world's leading economies signals our support for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance that will grow our exports and create new jobs.That's all on the growth front.And next we made enormous strides in committing ourselves to comprehensive reform of a failed regulatory system.\u00a0 And together, I believe that we must put an end to the bubble-and-bust economy that has stood in the way of sustained growth and enabled abusive risk-taking that endangers our prosperity.At home, back in the States, our efforts began with the approach that Secretary Geithner proposed last week, the strongest regulatory reforms any nation has contemplated so far to prevent the massive failure of responsibility that we have already seen.\u00a0 Today, these principles have informed and enabled the coordinated action that we will take with our G20 partners. To prevent future crises, we agreed to increased transparency and capital protections for financial institutions. We're extending supervision to all systemically important institutions, markets and products, including hedge funds.\u00a0 We'll identify jurisdictions that fail to cooperate, including tax havens, and take action to defend our financial system.\u00a0 We will reestablish the Financial Stability Forum with a stronger mandate.\u00a0 And we will reform and expand the IMF and World Bank so they are more efficient, effective and representative.Finally, we are protecting those who don't always have a voice at the G20, but who have suffered greatly in this crisis.\u00a0 And the United States is ready to lead in this endeavor.\u00a0 In the coming days, I intend to work with Congress to provide $448 million in immediate assistance to vulnerable populations -- from Africa to Latin America -- and to double support for food safety to over $1 billion so that we are giving people the tools they need to lift themselves out of poverty.\u00a0 We will also support the United Nations and World Bank as they coordinate the rapid assistance necessary to prevent humanitarian catastrophe.I have to say, though, that this is not just charity.\u00a0 These are all future markets for all countries, and future drivers of world economic growth.Let me also underscore my appreciation to Prime Minister Brown, his entire team, and all my colleagues from around the world who contributed to the summit's success.\u00a0 You know, it's hard for 20 heads of state to bridge their differences.\u00a0 We've all got our own national policies; we all have our own assumptions, our own political cultures.\u00a0 But our citizens are all hurting.\u00a0 They all need us to come together.\u00a0 So I'm pleased that the G20 has agreed to meet again this fall, because I believe that this is just the beginning.\u00a0 Our problems are not going to be solved in one meeting; they're not going to be solved in two meetings.\u00a0 We're going to have to be proactive in shaping events and persistent in monitoring our progress to determine whether further action is needed.I also want to just make a few remarks about additional meetings I had outside of the G20 context.\u00a0 While here in London I had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with leaders of Russia, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and India, as well as Great Britain.\u00a0 And these discussions were extraordinarily valuable and productive.\u00a0 Of course, we spoke about additional steps to promote economic recovery and growth.\u00a0 But we also discussed coordinated actions on a range of issues:\u00a0 how we could reduce the nuclear threat; how we could forge a coordinated response to North Korea's planned missile launch; how we can turn back terrorism and stabilize Afghanistan; how we can protect our planet from the scourge of climate change.\u00a0 I'm encouraged that we laid the groundwork for real and lasting progress on a host of these issues. Ultimately, the challenges of the 21st century can't be met without collective action.\u00a0 Agreement will almost never be easy, and results won't always come quickly.\u00a0 But I am committed to respecting different points of view, and to forging a consensus instead of dictating our terms.\u00a0 That's how we made progress in the last few days.\u00a0 And that's how we will advance and uphold our ideals in the months and years to come.You know, at home, I've often spoken about a new era of responsibility.\u00a0 And I believe strongly that this era must not end at our borders.\u00a0 In a world that's more and more interconnected, we all have responsibilities to work together to solve common challenges.\u00a0 And although it will take time, I am confident that we will rebuild global prosperity if we act with a common sense of purpose, persistence, and the optimism that the moment demands.So I appreciate your attention, and I'm going to take a few questions.\u00a0 I've got a list of a few people I'm going to call on and then I will intersperse some folks I'm calling on randomly.Helene Cooper. (There you are.)</p><p>Question:\u00a0  [Questions calling for President Obama to assess his\u00a0 performance during this, his first G20 conference.] </p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, I think we did okay.\u00a0 You know, when I came here, it was with the intention of listening and learning, but also providing American leadership.\u00a0 And I think that the document that has been produced as well as the concrete actions that will follow reflect a range of our priorities.\u00a0\u00a0 We wanted to make sure that we had a strong, coordinated response to growth -- and that's reflected in the document and in the actions that will be taken.\u00a0 We thought it was important to make sure that we had a strong, coordinated regulatory response\u00a0 -- and many of the details of the regulatory response draw from principles that we had developed prior to coming here.\u00a0 We felt that it was very important to strengthen our international financial institutions because developing countries, emerging markets are threatened -- even though they may not have been the cause of this crisis -- they are threatened by capital flight; they're threatened by reduced trade finance; drops in consumer demand in developed countries that were their export markets, and so we knew that it was going to be important to provide those countries with assistance.\u00a0 And we have created as fundamental a reworking of the resources available to these international financial institutions as anything we've done in the last several decades.So, overall, I'm pleased with the product.\u00a0 And I'll leave it to others to determine whether me and my team had anything to do with that.\u00a0 All right?Chuck Todd.\u00a0 Chuck.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 What concrete items that you got out of this G20 can you tell the American people back home who are hurting, the family struggling, seeing their retirement go down, or worrying about losing their job -- what happened here today that helps that family back home in the heartland?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, as I said before, we've got a global economy, and if we're taking actions in isolation in the United States, but those actions are contradicted overseas, then we're only going to be halfway effective -- maybe not even half.\u00a0 You've seen, for example, a drastic decline in U.S. exports over the last several months.\u00a0 You look at a company like Caterpillar, in my home state of Illinois, which up until last year was doing extraordinarily well; in fact, export growth was what had sustained it even after the recession had begun.\u00a0 As a consequence of the world recession, as a consequence of the contagion from the financial markets debilitating the economies elsewhere, Caterpillar is now in very bad shape.\u00a0 So if we want to get Caterpillar back on its feet, if we want to get all those export companies back on their feet, so that they are hiring, putting people back to work, putting money in people's pockets, we've got to make sure that the global economy as a whole is successful.\u00a0 And this document, which affirms the need for all countries to take fiscal responses that increase demand, that encourages the openness of markets, those are all going to be helpful in us being able to fix what ails the economy back home.Let me mix in a -- Justin Webb, BBC.\u00a0 Where's Justin?\u00a0 There he is.\u00a0 Go ahead.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Mr. President, in the spirit of openness, with which you say you're -- </p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Why don't you get a microphone?\u00a0 See, everybody is complaining.\u00a0 I'm sure that's all your fellow British journalists.</p><p>Question: They're extraordinarily well behaved, Mr. President.\u00a0 In the spirit of openness, with which you say you're going to run your Administration, could you give us an insight into an area or areas where you came to London wanting something and you didn't get it; where you compromised, where you gave something away to achieve the wider breakthrough agreement?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, I think that if you look at the language of the document, there are probably some areas where it wasn't so much of a sacrifice as it might not have been our number-one priority, but it became clear that it was very important to certain other actors. I'd rather not specify what those precise items would be, because this is a collective document.\u00a0 But there's no doubt that each country has its own quirks and own particular issues that a leader may decide is really, really important; something that is non-negotiable for them.\u00a0 And what we tried to do as much as possible was to accommodate those issues in a way that didn't -- did not hamper the effectiveness of the overall document to address what I think are the core issues related to this crisis.Now, keep in mind -- I think that this kind of coordination really is historic.\u00a0 I said in the meeting that if you had imagined 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, or 30 years ago, that you'd have the leaders of Germany, France, China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa, a President of the United States named Obama -- former adversaries, in some cases former mortal enemies, negotiating this swiftly on behalf of fixing the global economy, you would have said, that's crazy.\u00a0 And yet it was happening, and it happened with relatively little -- relatively few hiccups.\u00a0 And I think that's a testimony to the great work that Gordon Brown did, and his team, in organizing the summit, the collective work in our teams in doing some good preparation, some good ground work.\u00a0 So I'm very proud of what's been done.\u00a0 This alone is not enough.\u00a0 And obviously the actions that each of us take in our individual countries are still absolutely vital.\u00a0 So we have a set of principles, for example, around dealing with systemic risk that I think will be very important in preventing the kinds of financial crises that we've seen.\u00a0That does not entirely solve the problem of toxic assets that are still in U.S. banks and certain British banks and certain European banks.\u00a0 And how each individual nation acts to deal with that is still going to be vitally important.\u00a0 How well we execute the respective stimulus programs around the world is going to be very important.\u00a0 The quicker they are, the more effective they are at actually boosting demand, the more all of us will benefit.\u00a0 The more encumbered they are by bureaucracy and mismanagement and corruption, that will hamper our development efforts as a whole.So this is not a panacea, but it is a critical step, and I think it lays the foundation so that, should the actions that we've taken individually and collectively so far not succeed in boosting global demand and growth, should you continue to see a freezing of credit or a hemorrhaging of jobs around the world, I think we've created a good foundation for this leadership to come back together again and take additional steps until we get it right.Okay, Michael Shear.\u00a0 Where's Michael?</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 I wonder if you view this trip that you're on and the actions that you've taken here at the G20 and with the bilateral meetings that you've had as representing a break from the foreign policy of your predecessor. And if so, could you describe where you see and how you see the principles that guide a different view of the world?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, you know, I didn't accompany President Bush on his various summits, so I don't know how he was operating.\u00a0 And I won't -- I won't warrant a guess on that.I can tell you that what I've tried to do since I started running for President and since I was sworn in as President, is to communicate the notion that America is a critical actor and leader on the world stage, and that we shouldn't be embarrassed about that, but that we exercise our leadership best when we are listening; when we recognize that the world is a complicated place and that we are going to have to act in partnership with other countries; when we lead by example; when we show some element of humility and recognize that we may not always have the best answer, but we can always encourage the best answer and support the best answer.So I think that's the -- that's the approach that we've tried to take in our foreign policy since my Administration came in.\u00a0 Now, we come in at extraordinarily challenging times, and yet I actually think that that calls for this type of leadership even more.\u00a0 But, ultimately, we won't know how effective we are until we look back a year from now, or two years from now, or three years from now and see if it worked.\u00a0 And what the American people care about I suspect are the same thing that the British people care about, and that is, are you putting people back to work?\u00a0 Are businesses growing again?\u00a0 Is business -- is credit flowing again?\u00a0 And, you know -- and that's just true with respect to this summit.\u00a0 But when it comes to our Afghanistan policy, the question is going to be, have we made ourselves safer; have we reduced the risks and incidents of terrorism?And so the proof of the pudding is in the eating.\u00a0 But hopefully, I think at least we've set a tone internationally where people don't -- where they give us the benefit of the doubt.\u00a0 They're still going to have their interests, and we're going to have ours.\u00a0 There are going to be tough negotiations, and sometimes we're going to have to walk away from those negotiations if we can't arrive at a common accord.\u00a0 There are going to be real dangers that can't always be talked through and have to be addressed.\u00a0 But at least we can start with the notion that we're prepared to listen and to work cooperatively with countries around the world.All right, let me sprinkle in another -- it's got to be an international person.\u00a0 All right, this young lady right there.\u00a0 </p><p>Question:\u00a0 Mr. President, Emma Alberici from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\u00a0 At the moment, in the U.S., the U.K., and in Australia, executive salaries and bonuses are decided in the boardrooms of major publicly listed companies.\u00a0 Who will be making those decisions on salaries and bonuses as a result of the agreement you've made here today?\u00a0 And if it is still the boards, will they be guided by principles or legislation?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 The principles that we outlined I think put in place or move us in the direction of what I consider to be best practices, which is that there is some accountability with respect to executive compensation.Now, theoretically, that should be the shareholders.\u00a0 But the way that too many corporations have operated for too long is that you have a CEO who basically selects his board; the board, in a fairly cozy relationship oftentimes with the executive, hires a executive compensation firm, which, surprisingly, tends to think that it's necessary to retain the best talent to pay people $20 or $30 million a year; and we get into the kinds of habits and practices that I think have not been -- have not served shareholders well, I think ultimately distort the decision-making of many CEOs.When I was in the United States Senate, I actually worked on a piece of legislation that would -- made the simple proposition that executive compensation should be subject to a shareholder vote, even if it was nonbinding, so that there was transparency and accountability and perhaps a shame function that would take place.\u00a0 And that principle, I think, is reflected in these guidelines.What it says is, is that if you get shareholders involved and those shareholders are given a set of principles and best practices by which they can judge executive compensation, then you can still have outsized rewards and success for successful business people, but it will be based on not short-term performance, not three-month performance, not your ability to flip quick profits off products like derivatives that don't turn out to be particularly productive to the company, but based on sustained, effective growth.\u00a0 And that's what's embodied in these documents, and I think that you're going to see a lot of countries try to encourage that kind of transparency and accountability. It doesn't mean the state micromanaging -- [sneezes] -- excuse me -- I've been fighting this all week -- it doesn't mean that we want the state dictating salaries; we don't.\u00a0 We -- I strongly believe in a free-market system, and as I -- as I think people understand in America, at least, people don't resent the rich; they want to be rich.\u00a0 And that's good.\u00a0 But we want to make sure that there's mechanisms in place that holds people accountable and produces results.\u00a0 Okay?Got to go back to my crew.\u00a0 Jake Tapper.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Two questions.\u00a0 One, can you say with confidence that the steps the G20 nations are taking today -- committing to today will help the world, or will prevent the world to avoid a depression or a deeper recession?And two, your friend and ally, Prime Minister Brown, said that \"The old Washington consensus is over; today we have reached a new consensus.\"\u00a0 Is he right?\u00a0 And what do you think he meant by that?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 In life there are no guarantees; in economics there are no guarantees.\u00a0 The people who thought they could provide guarantees, many of them worked at AIG and it didn't work out so well.\u00a0 So there are always risks involved.\u00a0 I have no doubt, though, that the steps that have been taken are critical to preventing us sliding into a depression.\u00a0 They are bolder and more rapid than any international response that we've seen to a financial crisis in memory.\u00a0 And I think that they will have a concrete effect in our ability, individually, in each nation, to create jobs, save jobs that exist, grow the economy, loosen up credit, restore trust and confidence in the financial markets.So these steps -- another way of putting it is I think the steps in the communiqu\u00e9 were necessary.\u00a0 Whether they're sufficient, we've got to -- we've got to wait and see.\u00a0 I'm actually confident, though, that given the common commitment in the United States and in the other G20 countries to act rapidly and boldly, that if we see other inklings of panic in the marketplace, or things unwinding, that this group, once again, will respond as needed.So I guess maybe just to use an analogy that was used several times in this meeting, an analogy that I've used in the past:\u00a0 You got a sick patient; I think we applied the right medicine; I think the patient is stabilized; there's still wounds that have to heal and there's still emergencies that could arise, but I think that you've got some pretty good care being applied.You had a second, follow-up question?</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Prime Minister Brown saying -- </p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Oh, the Washington consensus.\u00a0 Well, the Washington consensus, as I'm sure you're aware, Jake, is sort of a term of art about a certain set of policies surrounding globalization and the application of a cookie-cutter model to economic growth, trade liberalization, deregulation that was popular and did help globalize and grow the economy, and was led by some of our leading economists and policymakers in Washington.\u00a0 I think that there's always been a spectrum of opinion about how unfettered the free market is.\u00a0 And along that spectrum, I think there have been some who believe in very fierce regulation and are very suspicious of globalization, and there are others who think that it's always -- that the market is always king.\u00a0 And I think what we've learned here, but if anybody had been studying history they would have understood earlier, is that the market is the most effective mechanism for creating wealth and distributing resources to produce goods and services that history has ever known, but that it goes off the rail sometimes; that if it's completely unregulated, that if there are no thoughtful frameworks to channel the creative energy of the market, that it can end up in a very bad place.And so, in that sense, I think that we just went through a couple of decades where there was an artificial complacency about the dangers of markets going off the rails.\u00a0 And a crisis like this reminds us that we just have to put in some common-sense rules of the road, without throwing out the enormous benefits that globalization have brought in terms of improving living standards, reducing the cost of goods, and bringing the world closer together.All right, I've got time for just a couple more questions.\u00a0 I'm going to find a journalist here --</p><p>Question:\u00a0 -- [inaudible]</p><p>Question:\u00a0 How about me?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 All right, I'm going to call on this gentleman right here.\u00a0 He's been very persistent.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0 China Central Television.\u00a0 Since the world leaders have been talking about increasing the voice and voting rights of developing countries, I would like to ask two questions instead of just one.\u00a0 First of all, on behalf of China --</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 I may choose which one I want to answer.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Of course.\u00a0 </p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 That's always the danger of asking two questions.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 First of all, you've had a very fruitful meeting with our President.\u00a0 And during the Clinton Administration, U.S.-China relationship were characterized, in Clinton's words, \"strategic, constructive partnership.\"\u00a0 During the Bush era, it was -- the catchphrase was \"stakeholder.\"\u00a0 The Bush Administration expects China to become a responsible stakeholder in international affairs.\u00a0 Have you come up with a catchphrase of your own?\u00a0 And certainly it is not the G2, is it?My second question is, on behalf of the world, politics is very local, even though we've been talking about global solution, as indicated by your recent preference over American journalists and British -- which is okay.\u00a0 How can you make sure that you will do whatever you can so that -- that local politics will not trump or negatively affect good international economics? Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, those are excellent questions.\u00a0 On the first question, your American counterparts will tell you I'm terrible with those little catchphrases and sound bites.\u00a0 So I haven't come up with anything catchy yet, but if you have any suggestions, let me know.\u00a0 I'll be happy to use them.In terms of local politics, look, I'm the President of the United States.\u00a0 I'm not the President of China, I'm not the President of Japan, I'm not the President of the other participants here.\u00a0 And so I have a direct responsibility to my constituents to make their lives better.\u00a0 That's why they put me in there.\u00a0 That accounts for some of the questions here, about how concretely does me being here help them find a job, pay for their home, send their kids to college, live what we call the American Dream.\u00a0 And I will be judged by my effectiveness in meeting their needs and concerns.\u00a0\u00a0 But in an era of integration and interdependence, it is also my responsibility to lead America into recognizing that its interests, its fate is tied up with the larger world; that if we neglect or abandon those who are suffering in poverty, that not only are we depriving ourselves of potential opportunities for markets and economic growth, but ultimately that despair may turn to violence that turns on us; that unless we are concerned about the education of all children and not just our children, not only may we be depriving ourselves of the next great scientist who's going to find the next new energy source that saves the planet, but we also may make people around the world much more vulnerable to anti-American propaganda.So if I'm effective as America's President right now, part of that effectiveness involves holding a -- providing Americans insight into how their self-interest is tied up with yours.\u00a0 And that's an ongoing project because it's not always obvious.\u00a0 And there are going to be times where short-term interests are going to differ; there's no doubt about it.\u00a0 And protectionism is the classic example.\u00a0 You can make arguments that if you can get away with protecting your markets, as long as the other folks don't protect theirs, then in the short term you may benefit.\u00a0 And it then becomes important not only for me to try to give people a sense of why, over the long term, that's counterproductive, but also it becomes important for me to put policies in place in the United States that provide a cushion, provide support for those people who may suffer local dislocations because of globalization.\u00a0 And that's something that I think every government has to think about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are individuals who will be harmed by a trade deal.\u00a0 There are businesses who will go out of business because of free trade.\u00a0 And to the extent that a government is not there to help them reshape their company or retrain for the new jobs that are being created, over time you're going to get people who see -- who rightly see their personal self-interest in very narrow terms.\u00a0 Okay?Two more questions.\u00a0 Jonathan Weisman. </p><p>Question: \u00a0Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 During the campaign you often spoke of a diminished power and authority of the United States over the last decade.\u00a0 This is your first time in an international summit like this, and I'm wondering what evidence you saw of what you spoke of during the campaign.\u00a0 And specifically, is the declaration of the end of the Washington consensus evidence of the diminished authority that you feared was out there?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable.\u00a0 I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous Administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.\u00a0 And that wasn't simply my opinion; that was, it turns out, the opinion of many people around the world.\u00a0 I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.\u00a0 And although, as you know, I always mistrust polls, international polls seem to indicate that you're seeing people more hopeful about America's leadership.Now, we remain the largest economy in the world by a pretty significant margin.\u00a0 We remain the most powerful military on Earth.\u00a0 Our production of culture, our politics, our media still have -- I didn't mean to say that with such scorn, guys -- you know I'm teasing -- still has enormous influence.\u00a0 And so I do not buy into the notion that America can't lead in the world.\u00a0 I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that we had important things to contribute.\u00a0 I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.\u00a0 Just a -- just to try to crystallize the example, there's been a lot of comparison here about Bretton Woods.\u00a0 \"Oh, well, last time you saw the entire international architecture being remade.\"\u00a0 Well, if there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- that's an easier negotiation.\u00a0 But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in.And so that's not a loss for America; it's an appreciation that Europe is now rebuilt and a powerhouse.\u00a0 Japan is rebuilt, is a powerhouse.\u00a0 China, India -- these are all countries on the move.\u00a0 And that's good.\u00a0 That means there are millions of people -- billions of people -- who are working their way out of poverty.\u00a0 And over time, that potentially makes this a much more peaceful world.\u00a0 \u00a0And that's the kind of leadership we need to show -- one that helps guide that process of orderly integration without taking our eyes off the fact that it's only as good as the benefits of individual families, individual children:\u00a0 Is it giving them more opportunity; is it giving them a better life?\u00a0 If we judge ourselves by those standards, then I think America can continue to show leadership for a very long time.I'm going to call one foreigner -- actually, I'm the foreigner.\u00a0 That's why I smiled.\u00a0 One correspondent not from America.\u00a0 And then I will -- [vociferous commotion] -- we're not doing bidding here.\u00a0 But I also want to make sure that I'm not showing gender bias.\u00a0 So this young lady right here -- not you, sir, I'm sorry.\u00a0</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Hi, Mr. President. </p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 How are you?</p><p>Question: \u00a0Thank you for choosing me.\u00a0 I'm very well.\u00a0 I'm from the Times of India.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Wonderful.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 You met with our Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.\u00a0 What did you -- what is America doing to help India tackle terrorism emanating from Pakistan?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, first of all, your Prime Minister is a wonderful man.</p><p>Question: \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 I agree.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well -- </p><p>Question: \u00a0I agree.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Did you have something to do with that, or -- You seem to kind of take -- take credit for it a little bit there. \u00a0</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Really proud of him, sir.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Of course.\u00a0 You should be proud of him.\u00a0 I'm teasing you.I think he's a very wise and decent man, and has done a wonderful job in guiding India, even prior to being Prime Minister, along a path of extraordinary economic growth that is a marvel, I think, for all the world.We did discuss the issue of terrorism.\u00a0 And we discussed it not simply in terms of terrorism emanating from Pakistan, although obviously we are very concerned about extremists and terrorists who have made camp in the border regions of Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan.\u00a0 But we spoke about it more broadly in terms of how we can coordinate effectively on issues of counterterrorism.\u00a0 We also spoke about the fact that in a nuclear age, at a time when perhaps the greatest enemy of both India and Pakistan should be poverty, that it may make sense to create a more effective dialogue between India and Pakistan.\u00a0 But obviously we didn't go in depth into those issues.\u00a0 We talked about a whole range of other issues related to, for example, energy, and how important it is for the United States to lead by example in reducing our carbon footprint so that we can help to forge agreements with countries like China and India that, on a per-capita basis, have a much smaller footprint and so justifiably chafe at the idea that they should have to sacrifice their development for our efforts to control climate change; but also acknowledging that if China and India, with their populations, had the same energy usage as the average American, then we would have all melted by now.And so that was a very interesting conversation that I will be pursuing not just with India, but hopefully with China and with other countries around the world.\u00a0 In some ways our European counterparts have moved more quickly than we have on this issue. But I think even the Europeans have recognized that it's not easy.\u00a0 It's even harder during times of economic downturn.And so we're going to have to combine the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency with rapid technological advances.\u00a0 And to the extent that in some cases we can get international cooperation and pool our scientific and technical knowledge around things like developing coal sequestration, for example, that can be extremely helpful.\u00a0 Okay?I'm going to call on my last American correspondent, Chip.\u00a0 And, Chip, my heart goes out to you.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 I appreciate that.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 I just heard about that.</p><p>Question:\u00a0 Certainly there is a lot of sentiment in G20 countries that the United States was a major cause of the global economic meltdown.\u00a0 To what degree did that topic come up in your discussions?\u00a0 Did it make it difficult for some countries to accept advice from the United States when they blame the United States and its economic system for causing this in the first place?\u00a0 And how do you respond to people who do blame America?</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, you know, I don't think that -- I think my colleagues in the G20 were extraordinarily gracious about my participation.\u00a0 I think that they continue to express the desire to work with America, admiration about many things American.\u00a0 There were occasional comments, usually wedged into some other topic, that indicated from their perspective that this started in America, or this started on Wall Street, or this started with particular banks or companies.Perhaps what helped was my willingness to acknowledge that\u00a0 -- and it's hard to deny -- that some of this contagion did start on Wall Street.\u00a0 And as I've said back home, as I've said in public and as I would say in private, we had a number of firms that took wild and unjustified risks, we had regulators that were asleep at the switch, and it has taken an enormous toll on the U.S. economy and has spread to the world economy.Now, I think that part of the reason people didn't give me too hard a time is because if you look at European banks or Asian banks, that they've had their own issues both in the past and in the future.\u00a0 And I think there was a very constructive discussion about the fact that, given global financial flows, that unless we've got much more effective coordinated regulatory strategies, supervision, standards, that these problems will appear again.Money is -- can move around the globe in a second.\u00a0 And it will seek out the highest returns, and if those highest returns end up being built on a house of cards, then we're going to be seeing another threat to the world financial system wherever that house of cards might be. And so, overall, I think there was an extraordinarily constructive approach among all the leaders.\u00a0 I was very impressed with them.\u00a0 I'm very grateful to them.\u00a0 And I'm excited about the ability not just to help heal this economy but also to make progress on a sustainable model of economic growth that relies less on a cycle of bubble and bust -- something that I've spoken about back home.All right?\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Appreciate it.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.02984599999999999, 51.50846010000001]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Rhenus Sports Arena", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Speech at Strasbourg Town Hall", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Bon apr\u00e8s-midi. And guten tag. It is a great honor for me to be here in Europe, to be here in Strasbourg. I want to make just a few acknowledgements. I want to thank the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, for being such a terrific friend. I want to thank his wife, Madam Sarkozy. They just hosted us at the palace and could not have been more gracious.I want to thank the Charge d'Affaires, Mark Pekala, and his wife, Maria, who were helping to organize us; Vincent Carver, who's the Counsel General in Strasbourg. And I want to thank the Mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, for his hospitality.It is wonderful to be here with all of you and to have an opportunity not only to speak to you but also to take some questions. You know, oftentimes during these foreign trips you see everything from behind a window, and what we thought was important was for me to have an opportunity to not only speak with you but also to hear from you, because that's ultimately how we can learn about each other. But before I take some questions, I hope you don't mind me making a few remarks about my country and yours; the relationship between the United States and the relationship between Europe.Strasbourg has been known throughout history as a city at the crossroads. Over thousands of years, you straddled many kingdoms and many cultures. Two rivers are joined here. Two religions have flourished in your churches. Three languages comprise an ancient oath that bears the city's name. You served as a center of industry and commerce, a seat of government and education, where Goethe studied and Pasteur taught and Gutenberg imagined his printing press.So it's fitting because we find ourselves at a crossroads as well -- all of us -- for we've arrived at a moment where each nation and every citizen must choose at last how we respond to a world that has grown smaller and more connected than at any time in its existence.We've known for a long time that the revolutions in communications and technology that took place in the 20th century would hold out enormous promise for the 21st century -- the promise of broader prosperity and mobility; of new breakthroughs and discoveries that could help us lead richer and fuller lives. But the same forces that have brought us closer together have also given rise to new dangers that threaten to tear our world apart -- dangers that cannot be contained by the nearest border or the furthest ocean.Even with the Cold War now over, the spread of nuclear weapons or the theft of nuclear material could lead to the extermination of any city on the planet. And this weekend in Prague, I will lay out an agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.We also know that the pollution from cars in Boston or from factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps in the Arctic, and that that will disrupt weather patterns everywhere. The terrorists who struck in London, in New York, plotted in distant caves and simple apartments much closer to your home. And the reckless speculation of bankers that has new fueled a global economic downturn that's inflicting pain on workers and families is happening everywhere all across the globe.The economic crisis has proven the fact of our interdependence in the most visible way yet. Not more than a generation ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that the inability of somebody to pay for a house in Florida could contribute to the failure of the banking system in Iceland. Today what's difficult to imagine is that we did not act sooner to shape our future.Now, there's plenty of blame to go around for what has happened, and the United States certainly shares its -- shares blame for what has happened. But every nation bears responsibility for what lies ahead, especially now, for whether it's the recession or climate change, or terrorism, or drug trafficking, poverty, or the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have learned that without a doubt there's no quarter of the globe that can wall itself off from the threats of the 21st century.The one way forward -- the only way forward -- is through a common and persistent effort to combat fear and want wherever they exist. That is the challenge of our time -- and we can not fail to meet it, together.Now, we take for granted the peace of a Europe that's united, but for centuries Strasbourg has been attacked and occupied and claimed by the warring nations of this continent. Now, today in this city, the presence of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe stand as symbols of a Europe that is united peaceful and free.Now, we take this peace and prosperity for granted, but this destination was not easily reached, nor was it predestined. The buildings that are now living monuments to European unity were not drawn from simple blueprints. They were born out of the blood of the first half of the 20th century and the resolve of the second. Men and women had to have the imagination to see a better future, and the courage to reach for it. Europeans and Americans had to have the sense of common purpose to join one another, and the patience and the persistence to see a long twilight struggle through.It was 61 years ago this April that a Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe helped to deliver hope to a continent that had been decimated by war. Amid the ashes and the rubble that surrounded so many cities like this one, America joined with you in an unprecedented effort that secured a lasting prosperity not just in Europe, but around the world -- on both sides of the Atlantic.One year later, exactly 60 years ago tomorrow, we ensured our shared security when 12 of our nations signed a treaty in Washington that spelled out a simple agreement: An attack on one would be viewed as an attack on all. Without firing a single shot, this Alliance would prevent the Iron Curtain from descending on the free nations of Western Europe. It would lead eventually to the crumbling of a wall in Berlin and the end of the Communist threat. Two decades later, with 28 member nations that stretched from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, NATO remains the strongest alliance that the world has ever known.At the crossroads where we stand today, this shared history gives us hope -- but it must not give us rest. This generation cannot stand still. We cannot be content merely to celebrate the achievements of the 20th century, or enjoy the comforts of the 21st century; we must learn from the past to build on its success. We must renew our institutions, our alliances. We must seek the solutions to the challenges of this young century.This is our generation. This is our time. And I am confident that we can meet any challenge as long as we are together.Such an effort is never easy. It's always harder to forge true partnerships and sturdy alliances than to act alone, or to wait for the action of somebody else. It's more difficult to break down walls of division than to simply allow our differences to build and our resentments to fester. So we must be honest with ourselves. In recent years we've allowed our Alliance to drift. I know that there have been honest disagreements over policy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship. In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad.On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated. They fail to acknowledge the fundamental truth that America cannot confront the challenges of this century alone, but that Europe cannot confront them without America.So I've come to Europe this week to renew our partnership, one in which America listens and learns from our friends and allies, but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden. Together, we must forge common solutions to our common problems.So let me say this as clearly as I can: America is changing, but it cannot be America alone that changes. We are confronting the greatest economic crisis since World War II. The only way to confront this unprecedented crisis is through unprecedented coordination.Over the last few days, I believe that we have begun that effort. The G20 summit in London was a success of nations coming together, working out their differences, and moving boldly forward. All of us are moving aggressively to restore growth and lending. All of us have agreed to the most substantial overhaul of our international financial system in a generation. No one is exempt. No more will the world's financial players be able to make risky bets at the expense of ordinary people. Those days are over. We are ushering a new era of responsibility, and that is something we should all be proud of.As we take these steps, we also affirm that we must not erect new barriers to commerce; that trade wars have no victors. We can't give up on open markets, even as we work to ensure that trade is both free and fair. We cannot forget how many millions that trade has lifted out of poverty and into the middle class. We can't forget that part of the freedom that our nations stood for throughout the Cold War was the opportunity that comes from free enterprise and individual liberty.I know it can be tempting to turn inward, and I understand how many people and nations have been left behind by the global economy. And that's why the United States is leading an effort to reach out to people around the world who are suffering, to provide them immediate assistance and to extend support for food security that will help them lift themselves out of poverty.All of us must join together in this effort, not just because it is right, but because by providing assistance to those countries most in need, we will provide new markets, we will drive the growth of the future that lifts all of us up. So it's not just charity; it's a matter of understanding that our fates are tied together -- not just the fate of Europe and America, but the fate of the entire world.And as we restore our common prosperity, we must stand up for our common security. As we meet here today, NATO has still embarked on its first mission overseas in Afghanistan, and my administration has just completed a review of our policy in that region.Now, I understand that this war has been long. Our allies have already contributed greatly to this endeavor. You've sent your sons and daughters to fight alongside ours, and we honor and respect their service and sacrifice.And I also know that there's some who have asked questions about why are we still in Afghanistan? What does this mean? What's its purpose? Understand we would not deploy our own troops if this mission was not indispensable to our common security. As President, I can tell you there's no decision more difficult, there's no duty more painful, than signing a letter to the family of somebody who has died in war.So I understand that there is doubt about this war in Europe. There's doubt at times even in the United States. But know this: The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. We were attacked by an al Qaeda network that killed thousands on American soil, including French and Germans. Along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, those terrorists are still plotting today. And they're -- if there is another al Qaeda attack, it is just as likely, if not more, that it will be here in Europe in a European city.So I've made a commitment to Afghanistan, and I've asked our NATO partners for more civilian and military support and assistance. We do this with a clear purpose: to root out the terrorists who threaten all of us, to train the Afghan people to sustain their own security and to help them advance their own opportunity, and to quicken the day when our troops come home.We have no interest in occupying Afghanistan. We have more than enough to do in rebuilding America. But this is a mission that tests whether nations can come together in common purpose on behalf of our common security. That's what we did together in the 20th century. And now we need an alliance that is even stronger than when it brought down a mighty wall in Berlin.That's why we applaud France's decision to expand and deepen its participation in NATO, just as we support a strong European defense. That's why we welcome Croatia and Albania into the fold. And that is why we must ensure that NATO is equipped and capable of facing down the threats and challenges of this new age. This is one of our central tasks.And we also know that in the 21st century, security is more complex than military power. This is the generation that must also stop the spread of the pollution that is slowly killing our planet, from shrinking coastlines and devastating storms to widespread misery and famine and drought. The effects of climate change are now in plain sight.Europe has acted with a seriousness of purpose that this challenge demands. And in the last few months I'm proud to say that America has begun to take unprecedented steps to transform the way that we use energy. We appointed a special envoy to help us lead a global effort to reduce the carbon that we send in the atmosphere.But we all know that time is running out. And that means that America must do more. Europe must do more. China and India must do more. Rolling back the tide of a warming planet is a responsibility that we have to ourselves, to our children, and all of those who will inherit God's creation long after we are gone. So let us meet that responsibility together. I am confident that we can meet it. But we have to begin today.And let us resolve that when future generations look back on ours, they will be able to say that we did our part to make this world more peaceful.It's perhaps the most difficult work of all to resolve age-old conflicts, to heal ancient hatreds, to dissolve the lines of suspicion between religions and cultures, and people who may not look like us, or have the same faith that we do, or come from the same place. But just because it's difficult does not make the work any less important. It does not absolve us from trying.And to that end, America will sustain our effort to forge and secure a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I've sent a clear message to the leaders and peoples of Iran that while we have real differences, we also have mutual interests, and we seek new engagement based on mutual respect. And it is in that spirit that America and Europe must reach out to the vast majority of Muslims in our nations and in all nations. We seek only hope of peace and partnership, and the opportunity of a better life.We cannot simply solve these conflicts militarily. We have to open our minds and we have to open our hearts to the differences among us and the commonalities between us. With every threat that we face, a new day is possible. We can't get there alone. As it was in the darkest days after World War II, when a continent lay in ruins and an atomic cloud had settled over the world, we must make the journey together.We know that transformational change is possible. We know this because of three reasons: First, because, for all our differences, there are certain values that bind us together and reveal our common humanity: the universal longing to live a life free from fear, and free from want; a life marked by dignity and respect and simple justice.Our two republics were founded in service of these ideals. In America, it is written into our founding documents as \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" In France: \"Libert\u00e9\" -- absolutely -- \"egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.\" Our moral authority is derived from the fact that generations of our citizens have fought and bled to uphold these values in our nations and others.And that's why we can never sacrifice them for expedience's sake. That's why I've ordered the closing of the detention center in Guantanamo Bay. That's why I can stand here today and say without equivocation or exception that the United States of America does not and will not torture.The second way that we can turn challenge into opportunity is through our persistence in the face of difficulty. In an age of instant gratification, it's tempting to believe that every problem can and should be solved in the span of a week. When these problems aren't solved, we conclude that our efforts to solve them must have been in vain. But that's not how progress is made. Progress is slow. It comes in fits and starts, because we try and we fail and then we try something else. And when there are setbacks and disappointments we keep going. We hold firm to our core values, and we hold firm to our faith in one another.The third reason we know that we can change this world is because of men and women like the young people who are here today. Each time we find ourselves at a crossroads, paralyzed by worn debates and stale thinking, the old ways of doing things, a new generation rises up and shows the way forward. As Robert Kennedy once told a crowd of students in South Africa, \"It is a revolutionary world that we live in, and thus, it is young people who must take the lead.\" Because young people are unburdened by the biases or prejudices of the past. That is a great privilege of youth. But it's also a tremendous responsibility because it is you who must ultimately decide what we do with this incredible moment in history.We just emerged from an era marked by irresponsibility, and it would be easy to choose the path of selfishness or apathy, of blame or division. But that is a danger that we cannot afford. The challenges are too great. It is a revolutionary world that we live in, and history shows us that we can do improbable, sometimes impossible things. We stand here in a city that used to stand at the center of European conflict; only now it is the center of European union. We did that together. Now we must not give up on one another. We must renew this relationship for a new generation, in a new century. We must hold firm to our common values, hold firm to our faith in one another. Together, I'm confident that we can achieve the promise of a new day.Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [7.7648448, 48.5999218]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Czech Republic", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Speech at Hradcany Square in Prague", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]*Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank you to the people of the Czech Republic.* </p><p>Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center of Europe. And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man who brought Michelle Obama to Prague.1To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States.I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people in my hometown of Chicago. Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. In 1918, after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- but I am honored to follow his footsteps from Chicago to Prague. For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've known war and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics and in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit.When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Few people would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the United States. Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speak to an audience like this in Prague. Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a free nation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed as dreams.We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change.We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like.We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametov\u00e1 Revoluce -- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries can play a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. And it proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed that walls could come down; that peace could prevail.We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible.Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too, have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. And we've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to one another and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and that we reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart.\u00a0 That is the work that we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin.To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to create new jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means a change in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis.And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the International Monetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance.Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. Together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to you that in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead.To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago, after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could not afford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And we should -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on the people of this nation. We are bound by shared values, shared history -- We are bound by shared values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on one is an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time.The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed on our soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York to London, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen our cooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of common concern.\u00a0Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. More nations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be -- for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction. Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, \"Yes, we can.\" Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year. President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a new agreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them. That's the first step.Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation.The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. To strengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause.And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peaceful programs. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules. We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people.But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences.Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- now is the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build a stronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreans to change course.Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutual interests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. We want Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will support Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic can take. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe will be removed.So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay.So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials.We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should come together to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit on Nuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year.Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve.But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends.There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. I know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together.Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Those were the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot.Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a better future. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it. Together we can do it.Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [15.472962, 49.81749199999999]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Ankara, Turkey", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Speech to the Turkish Parliament", "article": "<p>\u00a0[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly fromaudio.]</p><p></p><p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly fromaudio.]</p><p>Mr. Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, distinguished members, I am honored to speak in this chamber, and I am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people.This is my first trip overseas as President of the United States. I've been to the </p><p>G20 summit in London, and the NATO summit in Strasbourg, and the European Union summit in Prague. Some people have asked me if I chose to continue my travels to Ankara and Istanbul to send a message to the world. And my answer is simple: Evet -- yes. Turkey is a critical ally. Turkey is an important part of Europe. And Turkey and the United States must stand together -- and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time.This morning I had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic. And I was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history. But it is also clear that the greatest monument to Ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone and marble. His greatest legacy is Turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that this assembly carries on today.This future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed. At the end of World War I, Turkey could have succumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancient empire. But Turkey chose a different future. You freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded a republic that commands the respect of the United States and the wider world.And there is a simple truth to this story: Turkey's democracy is your own achievement. It was not forced upon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice. Turkey draws strength from both the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of Turks that makes new progress for your people.Now, my country's democracy has its own story. The general who led America in revolution and governed as our first President was, as many of you know, George Washington. And like you, we built a grand monument to honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city that bears Washington's name. I can see the Washington Monument from the window of the White House every day.It took decades to build. There were frequent delays. Over time, more and more people contributed to help make this monument the inspiring structure that still stands tall today. Among those who came to our aid were friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to Washington and the country he helped to found.And one of those tributes came from Istanbul. Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helped to build the Washington Monument. Inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words: \"So as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.\" Over 150 years have passed since those words were carved into marble. Our nations have changed in many ways. But our friendship is strong, and our alliance endures.It is a friendship that flourished in the years after World War II, when President Truman committed our nation to the defense of Turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and Turkey committed itself into the NATO Alliance. Turkish troops have served by our side from Korea to Kosovo to Kabul. Together, we withstood the great test of the Cold War. Trade between our nations has steadily advanced. So has cooperation in science and research.The ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more Americans of Turkish origin live and work and succeed within our borders. And as a basketball fan, I've even noticed that Hedo Turkoglu and Mehmet Okur have got some pretty good basketball games.</p><p>The United States and Turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected -- no two nations do. But we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years. And because of the strength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both America and Turkey are stronger and the world is more secure.Now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: An economic crisis that recognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children; strains on our energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons; and the persistence of tragic conflict.These are the great tests of our young century. And the choices that we make in the coming years will determine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife or by a just, secure and lasting peace.This much is certain: No one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake in overcoming them. That is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground. That is why we must build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences. We are stronger when we act together. That is the message that I've carried with me throughout this trip to Europe. That is the message that I delivered when I had the privilege of meeting with your President and with your Prime Minister. That will be the approach of the United States of America going forward.Already, America and Turkey are working with the G20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedented economic crisis. Now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies take strong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit; to reject the pressures of protectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn; and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again.As we go forward, the United States and Turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for our people. The President and I this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade. There's enormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs. And we can increase new sources to not only free ourselves from dependence of other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to combat climate change. We should build on our Clean Technology Fund to leverage efficiency and renewable energy investments in Turkey. And to power markets in Turkey and Europe, the United States will continue to support your central role as an East-West corridor for oil and natural gas.This economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that Europe and the United States share with Turkey as a NATO ally, and the common values that we share as democracies. So in meeting the challenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a Europe that is truly united, peaceful and free.So let me be clear: The United States strongly supports Turkey's bid to become a member of the European Union. We speak not as members of the EU, but as close friends of both Turkey and Europe. Turkey has been a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and European institutions. Turkey is bound to Europe by more than the bridges over the Bosphorous. Centuries of shared history, culture, and commerce bring you together. Europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it. And Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe's foundation once more.Now, of course, Turkey has its own responsibilities. And you've made important progress towards membership. But I also know that Turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's good for EU membership, but because it's right for Turkey.In the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel. You've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly. You've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting Kurdish, and the world noted with respect the important signal sent through a new state Kurdish television station.These achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should be sustained. For democracies cannot be static -- they must move forward. Freedom of religion and expression lead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopening Halki Seminary will send such an important signal inside Turkey and beyond. An enduring commitment to the rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people. Robust minority rights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens.I say this as the President of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like me to vote, much less be President of the United States. But it is precisely that capacity to change that enriches our countries. Every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation. This work is never over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. That's why we prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture. All of us have to change. And sometimes change is hard.Another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past. The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.Human endeavor is by its nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight. Each country must work through its past. And reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future. I know there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915. And while there's been a good deal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the Turkish and Armenian people deal with the past. And the best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest, open and constructive.We've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by Turkish and Armenian leaders. These contacts hold out the promise of a new day. An open border would return the Turkish and Armenian people to a peaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations. So I want you to know that the United States strongly supports the full normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. It is a cause worth working towards.It speaks to Turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal and peaceful relations with all the South Caucasus nations. And to advance that peace, you can play a constructive role in helping to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long.Advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the Eastern Mediterranean. And here there's a cause for hope. The two Cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiations under the United Nations Good Offices Mission. The United States is willing to offer all the help sought by the parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bizonal and bicommunal federation.These efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds Turkey. And when we consider the challenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals.In the Middle East, we share the goal of a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Let me be clear: The United States strongly supports the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. That is a goal shared by Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. That is a goal that the parties agreed to in the road map and at Annapolis. That is a goal that I will actively pursue as President of the United States.We know the road ahead will be difficult. Both Israelis and Palestinians must take steps that are necessary to build confidence and trust. Both Israelis and Palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made. Both must overcome longstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace.The United States and Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey. Like the United States, Turkey has been a friend and partner in Israel's quest for security. And like the United States, you seek a future of opportunity and statehood for the Palestinians. So now, working together, we must not give into pessimism and mistrust. We must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supporting negotiations between Syria and Israel. We must extend a hand to those Palestinians who are in need, while helping them strengthen their own institutions. We must reject the use of terror, and recognize that Israel's security concerns are legitimate.The peace of the region will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions. Now, as I made clear in Prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all Turkey. You live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well. This part of the world has known enough violence. It has known enough hatred. It does not need a race for an ever-more powerful tool of destruction.Now, I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United States seeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We want Iran to play its rightful role in the community of nations. Iran is a great civilization. We want them to engage in the economic and political integration that brings prosperity and security. But Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people.So both Turkey and the United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve as a safe haven for terrorists. I know there were differences about whether to go to war. There were differences within my own country, as well. But now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future of Iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region. As I've already announced, and many of you are aware, the United States will remove our combat brigades by the end of next August, while working with the Iraqi government as they take responsibility for security. And we will work with Iraq, Turkey, and all Iraq's neighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security.Make no mistake, though: Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat from terrorism. That includes the al Qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive Iraqis apart and destroy their country. That includes the PKK. There is no excuse for terror against any nation. As President, and as a NATO ally, I pledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the PKK or anyone else. These efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between Turkey, the Iraqi government, and Iraq's Kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity and democracy for the Kurdish population here inside Turkey.Finally, we share the common goal of denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The world has come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists plot further attacks. That's why we are committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda. That is why we are increasing our efforts to train Afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries. That's why we are increasing our support for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that we stand on the side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life.Turkey has been a true partner. Your troops were among the first in the International Security Assistance Force. You have sacrificed much in this endeavor. Now we must achieve our goals together. I appreciate that you've offered to help us train and support Afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across the region. Together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before.I know there have been difficulties these last few years. I know that the trust that binds the United States and Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith is practiced. So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not, and will never be, at war with Islam. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people.I also want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, and will not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek common ground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree. We will convey our deep appreciation for the Islamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country. The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in their families or have lived in a Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them.Above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future. I want to help more children get the education that they need to succeed. We want to promote health care in places where people are vulnerable. We want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people. In the months ahead, I will present specific programs to advance these goals. Our focus will be on what we can do, in partnership with people across the Muslim world, to advance our common hopes and our common dreams. And when people look back on this time, let it be said of America that we extended the hand of friendship to all people.There's an old Turkish proverb: \"You cannot put out fire with flames.\" America knows this. Turkey knows this. There's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise. But force alone cannot solve our problems, and it is no alternative to extremism. The future must belong to those who create, not those who destroy. That is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together.I know there are those who like to debate Turkey's future. They see your country at the crossroads of continents, and touched by the currents of history. They know that this has been a place where civilizations meet, and different peoples come together. They wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction or another.But I believe here is what they don't understand: Turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things. This is not where East and West divide -- this is where they come together. In the beauty of your culture. In the richness of your history. In the strength of your democracy. In your hopes for tomorrow.I am honored to stand here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach for together -- and to reaffirm America's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship.Thank you very much.

But there's a couple of things I want to say.\u00a0 Number one, thank you.You know, when I was at Camp Lejeune I spoke about what it means for America to see our best and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us. And what I said then is something that I want to repeat to you, which is:\u00a0You have performed brilliantly in every mission that has been given to you.Under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty and politics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job. And because of that, every mission that's been assigned -- from getting rid of Saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizing the country, to facilitating elections -- you have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country. That is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have the thanks of the American people.\u00a0 That's point number one.Point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months.\u00a0 I was just discussing this with your commander, but I think it's something that all of you know.\u00a0 It is time for us to transition to the Iraqis.\u00a0They need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty.And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations.\u00a0 They're going to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutional means and legal means.\u00a0 They are going to have to focus on providing government services that encourage confidence among their citizens.All those things they have to do.\u00a0We can't do it for them.\u00a0But what we can do is make sure that we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed to their success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces in order to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partner with us.And so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished, I want to say thank you because you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that Iraq is stable, that it is not a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can start bringing our folks home. So now is not the time to lose focus.\u00a0We have to be even more focused than we've been in order to achieve success.The last point I want to make is I know how hard it's been on a lot of you.\u00a0You've been away from your families, many of you for multiple rotations. You've seen buddies of yours injured and you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missing watching them grow up.\u00a0 There are many of you who have listened to your spouse and the extraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone.And so I want you to know that Michelle and myself are doing everything -- are doing everything we can to provide additional support for military families. The federal budget that I have introduced increases support for military families.\u00a0We are going to do everything required to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that people don't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service.The main point I want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we are grateful for what you will do, and as long as I am in the White House, you are going to get the support that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation.So thank you very much everybody.\u00a0God bless you.God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [44.2561195, 33.2838161]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "A New Foundation Speech at Georgetown", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing your family -- including JT -- appreciate you.

That's the America I see. That's the America that Georgetown is preparing so many of you for. That is the future that I know that we can have.</p><p>Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.</p><p>Recessions are not uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many times in our history. But this recession is different. This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.</p><p>As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the decade, the formula for buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americans found that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could not support. Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quick profit. The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made. Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposed to help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safest rating when they should have been labeled \"Buyer Beware.\"</p><p>No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the risks were. But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility. Banks took on more debt than they could handle.</p><p>The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities. Everybody was making record profits -- except the wealth created was real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability or oversight from anyone in Washington.</p><p>Then the housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime mortgages. And the value of all those loans and securities plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them. Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the market. Large financial institutions that didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held on tight to their money and simply stopped lending.</p><p>Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college education. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. So when banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan, a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global. And when other nations can't afford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.</p><p>So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office. So our most urgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do everything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economic crisis simultaneously.</p><p>The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal Reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment. My administration and Congress boosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. It's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks across America. And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.</p><p>Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should be cutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to tackle this argument head on.</p><p>To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sat around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back. And so have many businesses. And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if everybody -- if every family in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.</p><p>Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix. But the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, the key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.</p><p>So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.</p><p>The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stopped lending money. In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last administration used what they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporary financial assistance in order to get them lending again.</p><p>Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways the TARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. Ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks. But where that's not possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will hold accountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.</p><p>Of course, there are some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action.</p><p>And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequent questions in the letters that I get from constituents is, \"Where's my bailout?\" -- and I understand the sentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses. So that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the banks.</p><p>Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it. This is essentially the nationalization argument that some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federal government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the way that the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do so is yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- \"Why aren't you tougher on the banks?\"</p><p>So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or political judgment we've made about government involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern we have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess. Rather, it's because we believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.</p><p>Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest assured -- we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers and to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the old loans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.</p><p>Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance company, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more. And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you, nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because the entire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.</p><p>It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus contracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.</p><p>This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place. To do this, we've started a program that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans and student loans. And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.</p><p>In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with an important place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallen on hard times.</p><p>Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, so we've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through. And by the way, we owed that not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.</p><p>Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. In the meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers and their communities. And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century American auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a clean-energy future.</p><p>Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations in London the other week. Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed to pursue tougher regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all the major economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerable populations. That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.</p><p>We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.</p><p>So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these actions -- the Recovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle. They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress.</p><p>Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. And small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.</p><p>Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 will continue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs. The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should. The process for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices; we are not finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much more work to be done. But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.</p><p>But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean up balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- all that's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that led us to this point.</p><p>It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainable to have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets. It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity.</p><p>For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to our children. Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.</p><p>Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men. The first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as the wise man, for when \"the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\"</p><p>It was founded upon a rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build our house upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad.</p><p>It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century another American century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless risk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobs and new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future generations.</p><p>That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That must be our future -- and my administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.</p><p>Let me talk about each of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay down tough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again. Just as after the Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novel concept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k). So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.</p><p>The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy. You know, in the 20th century, the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. For decades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth. But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have set and we intend to do.</p><p>To meet that goal, we have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early childhood education. We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement. And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for every American, even those who attend Georgetown.</p><p>And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this in weeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things -- engineers, scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of that. But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making things that we can export to other countries.</p><p>Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions of new jobs and new industries. We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future. I don't know about you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders. I think it's time for America to lead again.</p><p>So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years. And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.</p><p>Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.</p><p>There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy recovers. And they are right that we have to take into account the costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy. But we can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.</p><p>If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now. And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put some money into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. That's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.</p><p>Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half million Americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis. Major American corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their doors. We can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.</p><p>And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control. And included in the budgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality health care affordable for every American. So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.</p><p>Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free. But in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific savings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.</p><p>In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy recovers.</p><p>Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We need to do more, but we've already done that. We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an important start. Secretary Gates recently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer. We need to do more, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.</p><p>Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need so we can make room for the things that we do need.</p><p>That's what we're doing now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.</p><p>Well, let me make three points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the world are cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are very serious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not on the short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.</p><p>Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's the argument that some critics have made: Well, you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.</p><p>Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spending money to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.</p><p>If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're right back where we are today. And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term budget situation. That's the second point.</p><p>Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.</p><p>But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary budget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.</p><p>Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costs across the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform is entitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. And that's one of the reasons why I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.</p><p>Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing. It's time for both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future generations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.</p><p>All of these efforts will require tough choices. All these efforts will require compromise. But the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to make today. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning. But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.</p><p>For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day. There's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems.</p><p>There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.</p><p>This can't be one of those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. I know how difficult it is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'd love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time. It's more than most Congresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.</p><p>But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.</p><p>There is no doubt that times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past. It's an America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so much about.</p><p>That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms. And we will not finish it in one year. We will not finish it in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand and the dream of our founders will live on in our time.</p><p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.07225849999999, 38.9076089]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Langley, Virginia", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "First Address at the Central Intelligence Agency", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Thank you for the extraordinary welcome.

And all of you look really young.\u00a0 And so to have a graybeard literally and figuratively like Steve Kappes here, I think, is absolutely critical.</p><p>I also want you to know that we have one of your own, </p><p>John Brennan, who is doing a terrific job as my adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security. And we are very grateful for the work that he does and the insights that he brings, from his long years of service here at the CIA.</p><p>And I would be remiss if I didn\u0092t mention the extraordinary former CIA officer and Director of Central Intelligence, </p><p>Bob Gates, who is also part of our Cabinet and every once in a while gives me a few tips. </p><p>So let me share with you just a few thoughts about the situation in which we find ourselves.</p><p>First, I want to underscore the importance of the CIA. When the CIA was founded, you were focused on one overarching threat, the Soviet Union. And for decades, the CIA carried out a critically important mission. And with the end of the Cold War, some wondered how important the CIA would be to our future. Now we know.</p><p>Here in the 21st century, we\u0092ve learned that the CIA is more important than ever. For as Leon mentioned, we face a wide range of unconventional challenges: stateless terrorist networks like al-Qaeda, the spread of catastrophic weapons, cyberthreats, failed states, rogue regimes, persistent conflict. And now we have to add to our list piracy.</p><p>The CIA is unique in the capabilities of collection, analysis and operation that you bring to bear. So you are an indispensable tool, the tip of the spear in America\u0092s intelligence mission and our national security.</p><p>It is because of you that I can make good decisions. You prove that the key to good intelligence is not simply technology. It\u0092s the quality of the men and women who have signed up to serve.</p><p>You\u0092re on the front lines against unconventional challenges.</p><p>You help us understand the world as it is. You support the work of our troops and our diplomats and law enforcement officers. You disrupt terrorist plots, and you\u0092re critical to our efforts to destroy terrorist networks. You serve capably, courageously, and from here in Virginia to dangerous outposts around the globe, you make enormous sacrifices on our behalf.</p><p>So you should be proud of what you do.</p><p>Second, you need to know that you\u0092ve got my full support. For decades, the American people have counted on you to protect them. I know that I\u0092ve come to personally count on your services. I rely on your reporting and your analysis, which finds its way onto my desk every single day.</p><p>And I know you\u0092ve got a tough job. I know there\u0092s no margin for error. And I know there are endless demands for intelligence. There is an urgent necessity to collect and analyze information and to work seamlessly with other agencies to act on it.</p><p>And -- And what makes it tougher is when you succeed, as you so often do, that success usually has to stay secret. So you don\u0092t get credit when things go good, but you sure get some blame when things don\u0092t.</p><p>Audience Member: [Words indistinct.]</p><p>President Obama: Now -- I got an amen corner out there.</p><p>Now, in that context, I know that the last few days have been difficult.</p><p>As I made clear, in releasing the </p><p>OLC memos as a consequence of a court case that was pending and to which it was very difficult for us to mount an effective legal defense, I acted primarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularly the fact that so much of the information was public -- had been publicly acknowledged. The covert nature of the information had been compromised.</p><p>I have fought to protect the integrity of classified information in the past, and I will do so in the future. And there is nothing more important than protecting the identities of CIA officers. So I need everybody to be clear: we will protect your identities and your security as you vigorously pursue your missions. I will be as vigorous in protecting you as you are vigorous in protecting the American people.</p><p>Now, I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those OLC memos. And I want to -- I want to be very clear and very blunt. I\u0092ve done so for a simple reason: because I believe that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of both our power and the power of our values, including the rule of law. I know I can count on you to do exactly that.</p><p>You know, there have been some conversations that I\u0092ve had with senior folks here at Langley in which I think people have expressed understandable anxiety and concern. So I -- I -- I want to make a point that I just made in the smaller group. I understand that it\u0092s hard when you are asked to protect the American people against people who have no scruples and would willingly and gladly kill innocents.</p><p>Al-Qaeda\u0092s not constrained by a constitution. Many of our adversaries are not constrained by a belief in freedom of speech or representation in court or rule of law. So I\u0092m sure that sometimes it seems as if that means we\u0092re operating with one hand tied behind our back or that those who would argue for a higher standard are naive. I understand that. You know, I\u0092ve -- I watch the cable shows once in a while.</p><p>What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and ideals even when it\u0092s hard -- not just when it\u0092s easy; even when we are afraid and under threat -- not just when it\u0092s expedient to do so. That\u0092s what makes us different.</p><p>So yes, you\u0092ve got a harder job. And so do I. And that\u0092s okay, because that\u0092s why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans.</p><p>And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies: because we\u0092re on the better side of history.</p><p>So don\u0092t be discouraged by what\u0092s happened in the last few weeks. Don\u0092t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we\u0092ve made some mistakes. That\u0092s how we learn. But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward, that is precisely why I am proud to be President of the United States, and that\u0092s why you should be proud to be members of the CIA. All right?</p><p>Third point -- Third point -- I want you to know how much the American people appreciate your service. Sometimes it\u0092s hard to acknowledge sacrifices made by the people whose work, or even identity, must remain secret, and that\u0092s part of the enormous burden that you carry when you sign up. But you make the extraordinary sacrifice of giving up parts of your life in service to your country. Many of you take long deployments overseas. You miss seeing your families; you miss weekend barbecues and the birthday parties, watching your children grow up. You can\u0092t even exchange in the simplest pleasures of talking about your job -- or complaining about your job openly.</p><p>There are few signs of patriotism more powerful than offering to serve out of the limelight, and so many of you have signed up to serve after 9/11 -- that\u0092s partly why you\u0092re all so young -- fully aware of the dangers before you. You serve courageously, but your courage is only known to a few. You accomplish remarkable things, but the credit you receive is the private knowledge that you\u0092ve done something to secure this country. That\u0092s a sacrifice that\u0092s carved into those marble walls. Those 89 stars stand as a testament to both the men and women of the CIA who gave their lives in service to their country, and to all who dedicate themselves to the mission of this agency.</p><p>Now we must look forward to the future with confidence. All that you\u0092ve achieved, I believe that the CIA\u0092s best days are still yet to come. And you will have my support and appreciation as you carry on this critical work.</p><p>We live in dangerous times. I am going to need you more than ever, precisely because we\u0092re seeing changes in our foreign policy, and we want to send a new message to the world. That requires better intelligence, not less of it. That means that we\u0092re going to have to operate smarter and more effectively than ever. So I\u0092m going to be relying on you, and the American people are going to rely on you. And I hope that you will continue to take extraordinary pride in the challenges that come with the job.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>God bless you. </p><p>And God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.1588685, 38.9464996]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Holocaust Days of Remembrance Ceremony Speech", "article": "<p></p><p>Thank you very much. To Sara Bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstanding work she's doing; to Fred Zeidman; Joel Geiderman; Mr. Wiesel -- thank you for your wisdom and your witness; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Dick Durbin; members of Congress; our good friend the Ambassador of Israel; members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council; and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are here today. It is a great honor for me to be here, and I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to address you briefly.</p><p>We gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them; honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living.</p><p>It is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history began in one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of human progress became tools of human depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education that can enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the bureaucracy that sustains modern life used as the machinery of mass death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient system where many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands.</p><p>While the uniqueness of the Holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, the Holocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughout history: the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity; the justifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of those who are neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the lie that good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice.</p><p>But while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are also here to pay tribute to the human impulse to save. In the moral accounting of the Holocaust, as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched into arms, we also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of Danish Jews ferried to safety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had also faithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone.</p><p>We remember the number five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today from Poland. We are awed by your acts of courage and conscience. And your presence today compels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did. We can only hope that the answer is yes.</p><p>We also remember the number 5,000 -- the number of Jews rescued by the villagers of Le Chambon, France -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents. Not a single Jew who came there was turned away, or turned in. But it was not until decades later that the villagers spoke of what they had done -- and even then, only reluctantly. The author of a book on the rescue found that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest. \"How could you call us 'good'?\" they said. \"We were doing what had to be done.\"</p><p>That is the question of the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good at extraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but because it is what must be done. They remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- these are choices we each have the power to make. They teach us that no one can make us into bystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone -- that if we have the courage to heed that \"still, small voice\" within us, we can form a minyan for righteousness that can span a village, even a nation.</p><p>Their legacy is our inheritance. And the question is, how do we honor and preserve it? How do we ensure that \"never again\" isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call to action?</p><p>I believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting the silence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator.</p><p>In the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable. My own great uncle returned from his service in World War II in a state of shock, saying little, alone with painful memories that would not leave his head. He went up into the attic, according to the stories that I've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months. He was one of the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable. And so some of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence -- all of whom we honor for their extraordinary service. My great uncle was part of the 89th Infantry Division -- the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. And they liberated Ohrdruf, part of Buchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished.</p><p>The story goes that when the Americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivors and the piles of dead bodies. And General Eisenhower made a decision. He ordered Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name. And he ordered American troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they were fighting against. Then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness. And he ordered that photographs and films be made. Some of us have seen those same images, whether in the Holocaust Museum or when I visited Yad Vashem, and they never leave you. Eisenhower said that he wanted \"to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.\"</p><p>Eisenhower understood the danger of silence. He understood that if no one knew what had happened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the perpetrators' ultimate triumph.</p><p>What Eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today. That's what Elie Wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make their memories part of our collective memory. That's what the Holocaust Museum does every day on our National Mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures and the lessons we've learned from our history. It's the very opposite of silence.</p><p>But we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation -- it's just the beginning. We know that evil has yet to run its course on Earth. We've seen it in this century in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. To this day, there are those who insist the Holocaust never happened; who perpetrate every form of intolerance -- racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim and diminishes us all.</p><p>Today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront these scourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, or wrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own. Instead we have the opportunity to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to commit ourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take -- whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can to prevent and end atrocities like those that took place in Rwanda, those taking place in Darfur. That is my commitment as President. I hope that is yours, as well.</p><p>It will not be easy. At times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection. But in the final analysis, I believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair -- the hope of a chosen people who have overcome oppression since the days of Exodus; of the nation of Israel rising from the destruction of the Holocaust; of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations.</p><p>It is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaning of courage and resilience and dignity. I'm thinking today of a study conducted after the war that found that Holocaust survivors living in America actually had a higher birthrate than American Jews. What a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world that has shown you so much cruelty; to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you have lost, in the end, you have a duty to life.</p><p>We find cause for hope as well in Protestant and Catholic children attending school together in Northern Ireland; in Hutus and Tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have done the unforgivable; in a movement to save Darfur that has thousands of high school and college chapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the Washington Mall -- people of every age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothers and sisters halfway around the world.</p><p>Those numbers can be our future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to make the journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately to reconciliation. That is what we mean when we say \"never again.\"</p><p>So today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility of redemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done. And may we strive each day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous.</p><p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0368707, 38.9071923]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "White House Correspondents Dinner Speech", "article": "<p></p><p>Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Good evening. You know, I had an entire speech prepared for this wonderful occasion, but now that I'm here I think I'm going to try something a little different. Tonight I want to speak from the heart. I'm going to speak off the cuff. </p><p>[Teleprompters rise.]</p><p>Good evening. Pause for laughter. Wait a minute, this may not be working as well as I -- Let me try that again. </p><p>Good evening, everybody. I would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of my first 100 days. I am Barack Obama. Most of you covered me. All of you voted for me. Apologies to the Fox table. They're -- Where are they? I have to confess I really did not want to be here tonight, but I knew I had to come -- just one more problem that I've inherited from George W. Bush.</p><p>But now that I'm here, it's great to be here. It's great to see all of you. Michelle Obama is here, the First Lady of the United States. Hasn't she been an outstanding First Lady? She's even begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matter which party you belong to we can all agree that Michelle has the right to bare arms.</p><p>Now Sasha and Malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded. You can't just take Air Force One on a joy ride to Manhattan. I don't care whose kids you are. We've been setting some ground rules here. They're starting to get a little carried away. </p><p>Now, speaking -- when I think about children obviously I think about Michelle and it reminds me that tomorrow is Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers in the audience. I do have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for Rahm Emanuel because he's not used to saying the word \"day\" after \"mother.\" That's true.</p><p>David Axelrod is here. You know, David and I have been together for a long time. I can still remember -- I got to sort of -- I tear up a little bit when I think back to that day that I called Ax so many years ago and said, you and I can do wonderful things together. And he said to me the same thing that partners all across America are saying to one another right now: Let's go to Iowa and make it official.</p><p>Michael Steele is in the house tonight. Or as he would say, \"in the heezy.\" What's up? Where is Michael? Michael, for the last time, the Republican Party does not qualify for a bailout. Rush Limbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, I'm sorry.</p><p>Dick Cheney was supposed to be here but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentatively titled, \"How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People.\"</p><p>You know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days. We've enacted a major economic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in Iraq, and no President in history has ever named three Commerce Secretaries this quickly. Which reminds me, if Judd Gregg is here, your business cards are ready now.</p><p>On top of that, I've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion -- signed an expansion of the children's health insurance. Just last week, Car and Driver named me auto executive of the year. Something I'm very proud of.</p><p>We've also begun to change the culture in Washington. We've even made the White House a place where people can learn and can grow. Just recently, Larry Summers asked if he could chair the White House Council on Women and Girls. And I do appreciate that Larry is here tonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime. Gibbs liked that one. </p><p>In the last hundred days, we've also grown the Democratic Party by infusing it with new energy and bringing in fresh, young faces like Arlen Specter. Now, Joe Biden rightly deserves a lot of credit for convincing Arlen to make the switch, but Secretary Clinton actually had a lot to do with it too. One day she just pulled him aside and she said, Arlen, you know what I always say -- \"if you can't beat them, join them.\" </p><p>Which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier White House, and that's my relationship with Hillary. You know, we had been rivals during the campaign, but these days we could not be closer. In fact, the second she got back from Mexico she pulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me I'd better get down there myself. Which I really appreciated. I mean, it was -- it was nice.</p><p>And of course we've also begun to change America's image in the world. We talked about this during this campaign and we're starting to execute. We've renewed alliances with important partners and friends. If you look on the screen there, there I am with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso. There I am with Gordon Brown.</p><p>But as I said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends. As hard as it is, we also have to talk to our enemies, and I've begun to do exactly that. Take a look at the monitor there. Now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of Peter Pan does not mean that I'm going to read it -- but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts.</p><p>All this change hasn't been easy. Change never is. So I've cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the White House. He's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. You just have to keep him on a tight leash. Every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble. But enough about Joe Biden.</p><p>All in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to Washington in these first hundred days but we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know. So I'd like to talk a little bit about what my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.</p><p>During the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my first hundred days. It's going to be big, folks. In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off the prompter and Joe Biden will learn to stay on the prompter.</p><p>In the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even John Boehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is a person of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world. What's up, John?</p><p>In the next hundred days, I will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist, who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority at the ballot box. It's good to see you, Mayor Bloomberg. </p><p>In the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, Bo, because the last thing Tim Geithner needs is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant. In the next hundred days, I will strongly consider losing my cool.</p><p>Finally, I believe that my next hundred days will be so successful I will be able to complete them in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest. </p><p>I just -- I want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whose job it is to inform the public and pursue the truth. You know, we meet tonight at a moment of extraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardship for the field of journalism. And like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seen sweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about what the future will hold.</p><p>Across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobs in recent days, recent weeks, recent months. And I know that each newspaper and media outlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply to stay open. And it won't be easy. Not every ending will be a happy one. </p><p>But it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of our democracy. It's what makes this thing work. You know, Thomas Jefferson once said that if he had the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, he would not hesitate to choose the latter. </p><p>Clearly, Thomas Jefferson never had cable news to contend with -- but his central point remains: A government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrant media of all sorts, is not an option for the United States of America.</p><p>So I may not -- I may not agree with everything you write or report. I may even complain, or more likely Gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but I do so with the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best. You help all of us who serve at the pleasure of the American people do our jobs better by holding us accountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling into easy political games that people are so desperately weary of. </p><p>And that kind of reporting is worth preserving -- not just for your sake, but for the public's. We count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives the way they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if -- </p><p>This is a season of renewal and reinvention. That is what government must learn to do, that's what businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing. And when I look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questions I've answered over the last few years, I know that for all the challenges this industry faces, it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment. It's not short of young people who are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough ones time and time again. These qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainly prove that the problems are worth solving. And that is a good place as any to begin.</p><p>So I offer you my thanks, I offer you my support, and I look forward to working with you and answering to you and the American people as we seek a more perfect union in the months and years ahead.</p><p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0454106,

"article": "<p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 I first of all want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for making this visit.\u00a0 I think we had a extraordinarily productive series of conversations, not only between the two of us but also at the staff and agency levels.</p><p>Obviously this reflects the extraordinary relationship, the special relationship between the United States and Israel.\u00a0 It is a stalwart ally of the United States.\u00a0 We have historical ties, emotional ties.\u00a0 As the only true democracy of the Middle East it is a source of admiration and inspiration for the American people.</p><p>I have said from the outset that when it comes to my policies towards Israel and the Middle East that Israel\u0092s security is paramount, and I repeated that to Prime Minister Netanyahu.\u00a0 It is in U.S. national security interests to assure that Israel\u0092s security as an independent Jewish state is maintained.</p><p>One of the areas that we discussed is the deepening concernaround the potential pursuit of a nuclear weapon by Iran.\u00a0 It\u0092s something the Prime Minister has been very vocal in his concerns about, but is a concern that is shared by his countrymen and women across the political spectrum.</p><p>I indicated to him the view of our administration, that Iran is a country of extraordinary history and extraordinary potential, that we want them to be a full-fledged member of the international community and be in a position to provide opportunities and prosperity for their people, but that the way to achieve those goals is not through the pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 And I indicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu in private what I have said publicly, which is that Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would not only be a threat to Israel and a threat to the United States, but would be profoundly destabilizing in the international community as a whole and could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that would be extraordinarily dangerous for all concerned, including for Iran.</p><p>We are engaged in a process to reach out to Iran and persuade them that it is not in their interest to pursue a nuclear weapon and that they should change course.\u00a0 But I assured the Prime Minister that we are not foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious.\u00a0 And obviously the Prime Minister emphasized his seriousness around this issue as well -- I\u0092ll allow him to speak for himself on that subject.</p><p>We also had an extensive discussion about the possibilities of restarting serious negotiations on the issue of Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 I have said before and I will repeat again that it is I believe in the interest not only of the Palestinians, but also the Israelis and the United States and the international community to achieve a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians are living side by side in peace and security.</p><p>We have seen progress stalled on this front, and I suggested to the Prime Minister that he has an historic opportunity to get a serious movement on this issue during his tenure.\u00a0 That means that all the parties involved have to take seriously obligations that they\u0092ve previously agreed to.\u00a0 Those obligations were outlined in the road map; they were discussed extensively in Annapolis.\u00a0 And I think that we can -- there is no reason why we should not seize this opportunity and this moment for all the parties concerned to take seriously those obligations and to move forward in a way that assures Israel\u0092s security, that stops the terrorist attacks that have been such a source of pain and hardship, that we can stop rocket attacks on Israel; but that also allow Palestinians to govern themselves as an independent state, that allows economic development to take place, that allows them to make serious progress in meeting the aspirations of their people.</p><p>And I am confident that in the days, weeks and months to come we are going to be able to make progress on that issue.</p><p>So let me just summarize by saying that I think Prime Minister Netanyahu has the benefit of having served as Prime Minister previously.\u00a0 He has both youth and wisdom --</p><p></p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu:\u00a0 I\u0092ll dispute youth, but --</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 -- and I think is in a position to achieve the security objectives of Israel, but also bring about historic peace.\u00a0 And I\u0092m confident that he\u0092s going to seize this moment.\u00a0 And the United States is going to do everything we can to be constructive, effective partners in this process.</p><p>PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:\u00a0 President Obama, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your friendship to Israel and your friendship to me.\u00a0 You\u0092re a great leader -- a great leader of the United States, a great leader of the world, a great friend of Israel, and someone who is acutely cognizant of our security concerns.\u00a0 And the entire people of Israel appreciate it, and I speak on their behalf.</p><p>We met before, but this is the first time that we\u0092re meeting as President and Prime Minister.\u00a0 So I was particularly pleased at your reaffirmation of the special relationship between Israel and the United States.\u00a0 We share the same goals and we face the same threats.\u00a0 The common goal is peace.\u00a0 Everybody in Israel, as in the United States, wants peace.\u00a0 The common threat we face are terrorist regimes and organizations that seek to undermine the peace and endanger both our peoples.</p><p>In this context, the worst danger we face is that Iran would develop nuclear military capabilities.\u00a0 Iran openly calls for our destruction, which is unacceptable by any standard.\u00a0 It threatens the moderate Arab regimes in the Middle East.\u00a0 It threatens U.S. interests worldwide.\u00a0 But if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, it could actually give terrorists nuclear weapons.\u00a0 And that would put us all in great peril.</p><p>So in that context, I very much appreciate, Mr. President, your firm commitment to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear military capability, and also your statement that you\u0092re leaving all options on the table.</p><p>I share with you very much the desire to move the peace process forward.\u00a0 And I want to start peace negotiations with the Palestinians immediately.\u00a0 I would like to broaden the circle of peace to include others in the Arab world, if we could, Mr. President, so -- this (inaudible) that one shouldn\u0092t let go, maybe peace with the entire Arab world.</p><p>I want to make it clear that we don\u0092t want to govern the Palestinians.\u00a0 We want to live in peace with them.\u00a0 We want them to govern themselves, absent a handful of powers that could endanger the state of Israel.\u00a0 And for this there has to be a clear goal.\u00a0 The goal has to be an end to conflict.\u00a0 There will have to be compromises by Israelis and Palestinians alike.\u00a0 We\u0092re ready to do our share.\u00a0 We hope the Palestinians will do their share, as well.\u00a0 If we resume negotiations, as we plan to do, then I think that the Palestinians will have to recognize Israel as a Jewish state; will have to also enable Israel to have the means to defend itself.\u00a0 And if those conditions are met, Israel\u0092s security conditions are met, and there\u0092s recognition of Israel\u0092s legitimacy, its permanent legitimacy, then I think we can envision an arrangement where Palestinians and Israelis live side by side in dignity, in security, and in peace.</p><p>And I look forward, Mr. President, to working with you, a true friend of Israel, to the achievement of our common goals, which are security, prosperity, and above all, peace.</p><p></p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 We\u0092re going to take a couple of questions.\u00a0 We\u0092re going to start with Steve.</p><p></p><p>Question: Mr. President, you spoke at length, as did the Prime Minister, about Iran\u0092s nuclear program.\u00a0 Your program of engagement, policy of engagement, how long is that going to last?\u00a0 Is there a deadline?</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 You know, I don\u0092t want to set an artificial deadline.\u00a0 I think it\u0092s important to recognize that Iran is in the midst of its own elections.\u00a0 As I think all of you, since you\u0092re all political reporters, are familiar with, election time is not always the best time to get business done.</p><p>Their elections will be completed in June, and we are hopeful that, at that point, there is going to be a serious process of engagement, first through the P5-plus-one process that\u0092s already in place, potentially through additional direct talks between the United States and Iran.</p><p>I want to reemphasize what I said earlier, that I believe it is not only in the interest of the international community that Iran not develop nuclear weapons, I firmly believe it is in Iran\u0092s interest not to develop nuclear weapons, because it would trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and be profoundly destabilizing in all sorts of ways.\u00a0 Iran can achieve its interests of security and international respect and prosperity for its people through other means, and I am prepared to make what I believe will be a persuasive argument, that there should be a different course to be taken.</p><p>The one thing we\u0092re also aware of is the fact that the history, of least, of negotiation with Iran is that there is a lot of talk but not always action and follow-through.\u00a0 And that\u0092s why it is important for us, I think, without having set an artificial deadline, to be mindful of the fact that we\u0092re not going to have talks forever.\u00a0 We\u0092re not going to create a situation in which talks become an excuse for inaction while Iran proceeds with developing a nuclear -- and deploying a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 That\u0092s something, obviously, Israel is concerned about, but it\u0092s also an issue of concern for the United States and for the international community as a whole.</p><p>My expectation would be that if we can begin discussions soon, shortly after the Iranian elections, we should have a fairly good sense by the end of the year as to whether they are moving in the right direction and whether the parties involved are making progress and that there\u0092s a good faith effort to resolve differences.\u00a0 That doesn\u0092t mean every issue would be resolved by that point, but it does mean that we\u0092ll probably be able to gauge and do a reassessment by the end of the year of this approach.</p><p></p><p>Question: Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Aren\u0092t you concerned that your outstretched hand has been interpreted by extremists, especially Ahmadinejad, Nasrallah, Meshal, as weakness?\u00a0 And since my colleague already asked about the deadline, if engagement fails, what then, Mr. President?</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, it\u0092s not clear to me why my outstretched hand would be interpreted as weakness.</p><p></p><p>Question: Qatar, an example.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 I\u0092m sorry?</p><p></p><p>Question: The example of Qatar.\u00a0 They would have preferred to be on your side and then moved to the extremists, to Iran.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Oh, I think -- yes, I\u0092m not sure about that interpretation.\u00a0 Look, we\u0092ve been in office a little over a hundred days now -- close to four months.\u00a0 We have put forward a clear principle that where we can resolve issues through negotiations and diplomacy, we should.\u00a0 We didn\u0092t expect -- and I don\u0092t think anybody in the international community or anybody in the Middle East, for that matter -- would expect that 30 years of antagonism and suspicion between Iran and the United States would be resolved in four months.\u00a0 So we think it\u0092s very important for us to give this a chance.</p><p>Now, understand that part of the reason that it\u0092s so important for us to take a diplomatic approach is that the approach that we\u0092ve been taking, which is no diplomacy, obviously has not worked.\u00a0 Nobody disagrees with that.\u00a0 Hamas and Hezbollah have gotten stronger.\u00a0 Iran has been pursuing its nuclear capabilities undiminished.\u00a0 And so not talking -- that clearly hasn\u0092t worked.\u00a0 That\u0092s what\u0092s been tried.\u00a0 And so what we\u0092re going to do is try something new, which is actually engaging and reaching out to the Iranians.</p><p>The important thing is to make sure that there is a clear timetable of -- at which point we say these talks don\u0092t seem to be making any serious progress.\u00a0 It hasn\u0092t been tried before so we don\u0092t want to prejudge that, but as I said, by the end of the year I think we should have some sense as to whether or not these discussions are starting to yield significant benefits, whether we\u0092re starting to see serious movement on the part of the Iranians.</p><p>If that hasn\u0092t taken place, then I think the international community will see that it\u0092s not the United States or Israel or other countries that are seeking to isolate or victimize Iran; rather, it is Iran itself which is isolating itself by willing to -- being unwilling to engage in serious discussions about how they can preserve their security without threatening other people\u0092s security -- which ultimately is what we want to achieve.</p><p>We want to achieve a situation where all countries in the region can pursue economic development and commercial ties and trade and do so without the threat that their populations are going to be subject to bombs and destruction.</p><p>That\u0092s what I think the Prime Minister is interested in, that\u0092s what I\u0092m interested in, and I hope that ends up being what the ruling officials in Iran are interested in, as well.</p><p>Don Gonyea.\u00a0 Where\u0092s Gonyea?</p><p></p><p>Question:\u00a0 Right here.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, can you each react to King Abdullah\u0092s statement of a week ago that we really are at a critical place in the conflict and that if this moment isn\u0092t seized and if a peace isn\u0092t achieved now, soon, that in a year, year and a half, we could see renewed major conflict, perhaps war?\u00a0 And do you agree with that assessment?</p><p></p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu:\u00a0 I think we have to seize the moment and I think we\u0092re fortunate in having a leader like President Obama and a new government in Israel and perhaps a new understanding in the Arab world that I haven\u0092t seen in my lifetime.\u00a0 And you\u0092re very kind to be calling me young, but I\u0092m more than half a century old and in my 59 years in the life of the Jewish state, there\u0092s never been a time when Arabs and Israelis see a common threat the way we see it today and also see the need to join together in working towards peace while simultaneously defending ourselves against this common threat.</p><p>I think we have -- we have ways to capitalize on this sense of urgency and we\u0092re prepared to move with the President and with others in the Arab world if they\u0092re prepared to move, as well.\u00a0 And I think the important thing that we discussed, among other things, is how to buttress the Israeli-Palestinian peace tracks, which we want to resume right away, with participation from others in the Arab world; how we give confidence to each other that would -- changes the reality, it changes the reality on the ground, changing political realities top-down, as well, while we work to broaden the circle of peace.</p><p>And I think that the sense of urgency that King Abdullah expressed is shared by me and shared by many others and I definitely know it\u0092s shared by President Obama.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Look, I think there\u0092s an extraordinary opportunity and the Prime Minister said it well.\u00a0 You have Arab states in the region -- the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Saudis -- who I think are looking for an opportunity to break this long-standing impasse but aren\u0092t sure how to do it, and share concerns about Iran\u0092s potential development of a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 In order for us to potentially realign interests in the region in a constructive way, bolstering, to use the Prime Minister\u0092s word, the Palestinian-Israeli peace track is critical.</p><p>It will not be easy.\u00a0 It never has been easy.\u00a0 In discussions, I don\u0092t think the Prime Minister would mind me saying to him -- or saying publically what I said privately, which is that there is a recognition that the Palestinians are going to have to do a better job providing the kinds of security assurances that Israelis would need to achieve a two-state solution; that, you know, the leadership of the Palestinians will have to gain additional legitimacy and credibility with their own people, and delivering services.\u00a0 And that\u0092s something that the United States and Israel can be helpful in seeing them accomplish.</p><p>The other Arab states have to be more supportive and be bolder in seeking potential normalization with Israel.\u00a0 And next week I will have the Palestinian Authority President Abbas as well as President Mubarak here and I will deliver that message to them.</p><p>Now, Israel is going to have to take some difficult steps as well, and I shared with the Prime Minister the fact that under the roadmap and under Annapolis that there\u0092s a clear understanding that we have to make progress on settlements.\u00a0 Settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward.\u00a0 That\u0092s a difficult issue.\u00a0 I recognize that, but it\u0092s an important one and it has to be addressed.</p><p>I think the humanitarian situation in Gaza has to be addressed.\u00a0 Now, I was along the border in Sderot and saw the evidence of weapons that had been raining down on the heads of innocents in those Israeli cities, and that\u0092s unacceptable.\u00a0 So we\u0092ve got to work with the Egyptians to deal with the smuggling of weapons and it has to be meaningful because no Prime Minister of any country is going to tolerate missiles raining down on their citizens\u0092 heads.</p><p>On the other hand, the fact is, is that if the people of Gaza have no hope, if they can\u0092t even get clean water at this point, if the border closures are so tight that it is impossible for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts to take place, then that is not going to be a recipe for Israel\u0092s long-term security or a constructive peace track to move forward.</p><p>So all these things are going to have to come together and it\u0092s going to be difficult, but the one thing that I\u0092ve committed to the Prime Minister is we are going to be engaged, the United States is going to roll up our sleeves.\u00a0 We want to be a strong partner in this process.</p><p>I have great confidence in Prime Minister Netanyahu\u0092s political skills, but also his historical vision and his recognition that during the years that he is Prime Minister this second go-around, he is probably going to be confronted with as many important decisions about the long-term strategic interests of Israel as any Prime Minister that we\u0092ve seen in a very long time.\u00a0 And I have great confidence that he\u0092s going to rise to the occasion and I actually think that you\u0092re going to see movement in -- among Arab states that we have not seen before.</p><p>But the trick is to try to coordinate all this in a very delicate political environment.\u00a0 And that\u0092s why I\u0092m so pleased to have George Mitchell, who is standing behind the scrum there, as our special envoy, because I\u0092m very confident that as somebody who was involved in equally delicate negotiations in Northern Ireland, he is somebody who recognizes that if you apply patience and determination, and you keep your eye on the long-term goal, as the Prime Minister articulated -- which is a wide-ranging peace, not a grudging peace, not a transitory peace, but a wide-ranging, regional peace -- that we can make great progress.</p><p></p><p>Question:\u00a0 Mr. President, the Israeli Prime Minister and the Israeli administration have said on many occasions -- on some occasions that only if the Iranian threat will be solved, they can achieve real progress on the Palestinian threat.\u00a0 Do you agree with that kind of linkage?</p><p>And to the Israeli Prime Minister, you were speaking about the political track.\u00a0 Are you willing to get into final status issues/negotiations like borders, like Jerusalem in the near future, based on the two-state solution?\u00a0 And do you still hold this opinion about the linkage between the Iranian threat and your ability to achieve any progress on the Palestinian threat?</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Well, let me say this.\u00a0 There\u0092s no doubt that it is difficult for any Israeli government to negotiate in a situation in which they feel under immediate threat.\u00a0 That\u0092s not conducive to negotiations.\u00a0 And as I\u0092ve said before, I recognize Israel\u0092s legitimate concerns about the possibility of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon when they have a president who has in the past said that Israel should not exist.\u00a0 That would give any leader of any country pause.</p><p>Having said that, if there is a linkage between Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, I personally believe it actually runs the other way.\u00a0 To the extent that we can make peace with the Palestinians -- between the Palestinians and the Israelis, then I actually think it strengthens our hand in the international community in dealing with a potential Iranian threat.</p><p>Having said that, I think that dealing with Iran\u0092s potential nuclear capacity is something that we should be doing even if there already was peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\u00a0 And I think that pursuing Israeli-Palestinian peace is something that is in Israeli\u0092s security interests and the United States\u0092 national security interests, even if Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 They\u0092re both important.</p><p>And we have to move aggressively on both fronts.\u00a0 And I think that based on my conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he agrees with me that they\u0092re both important.\u00a0 That\u0092s not to say that he\u0092s not making a calculation, as he should, about what are some of the most immediate threats to Israeli\u0092s security, and I understand that.</p><p>But, look, imagine how much less mischief a Hezbollah or a Hamas could do if in fact we had moved a Palestinian-Israeli track in a direction that gave the Palestinian people hope.\u00a0 And if Hezbollah and Hamas is weakened, imagine how that impacts Iran\u0092s ability to make mischief, and vice versa.</p><p>I mean, so obviously these things are related, but they are important separately.\u00a0 And I\u0092m confident that the United States, working with Israel, can make progress on both fronts.</p><p></p><p>Question: Thank you.</p><p></p><p>Prime Minister Netanyahu:\u00a0 We\u0092ve had extraordinarily friendly and constructive talks here today, and I\u0092m very grateful to the President for that.\u00a0 We want to move peace forward, and we want to ward off the great threats.</p><p>There isn\u0092t a policy linkage, and that\u0092s what I hear the President saying, and that\u0092s what I\u0092m saying too.\u00a0 And I\u0092ve always said there\u0092s not a policy linkage between pursuing simultaneously peace between Israel and the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world, and to trying to deal with removing the threat of a nuclear bomb.</p><p>There are causal links.\u00a0 The President talked about one of them.\u00a0 It would help, obviously, unite a broad front against Iran if we had peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\u00a0 And conversely, if Iran went nuclear, it would threaten the progress towards peace and destabilize the entire area, and threaten existing peace agreement.</p><p>So it\u0092s very clear to us.\u00a0 I think we actually -- we don\u0092t see closely on it, we see exactly eye to eye on this -- that we want to move simultaneously and then parallel on two fronts:\u00a0 the front of peace, and the front of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear capability.</p><p>On the front of peace, the important thing for me is to resume negotiations as rapidly as possible, and to -- and my view is less one of terminology, but one of substance.\u00a0 And I ask myself, what do we end up with?\u00a0 If we end up with another Gaza -- the President has described to you there\u0092s rockets falling out of Gaza -- that is something we don\u0092t want to happen, because a terror base next to our cities that doesn\u0092t call -- recognize Israel\u0092s existence and calls for our destruction and asks for our destruction is not arguing peace.</p><p>If, however, the Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish state, if they -- if they fight terror, if they educate their children for peace and to a better future, then I think we can come at a substantive solution that allows the two people to live side by side in security and peace and I add prosperity, because I\u0092m a great believer in this.</p><p>So I think the terminology will take care of itself if we have the substantive understanding.\u00a0 And I think we can move forward on this.\u00a0 I have great confidence in your leadership, Mr. President, and in your friendship to my country, and in your championing of peace and security.\u00a0 And the answer is, both come together -- peace and security are intertwined.\u00a0 They\u0092re inseparable.</p><p>And I look forward, Mr. President, to working with you to achieve both.</p><p></p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0365298, 38.8976763]}}, {"type": "Feature",

CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Thank you very much. Thank you, Notre Dame. Thank you. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Thank you...Well first of all, congratulations, Class of 2009. Congratulations to all the parents, the cousins, the aunts, the uncles -- the -- all the people who helped to bring you to the point that you are here today. Thank you so much to Father Jenkins for that extraordinary introduction, even though you said what I want to say much more elegantly. You are doing an extraordinary job as president of this extraordinary institution, and your continued and courageous and contagious commitment to honest, thoughtful dialogue is an inspiration to us all.So, good afternoon, to </p><p>Father Hesburgh, to Notre Dame trustees, to faculty, to family. I am honored to be here today. And...I am grateful to all of you for allowing me to be a part of your graduation.\u00a0And I also want to thank you for the honorary degree that I received. I know it has not been without controversy. I don't know if you're aware of this, but these honorary degrees are apparently pretty hard to come by. So far I'm only 1 for 2 as President. Father...Hesburgh is 150 for 150. I guess that's better. So, Father Ted after the ceremony maybe you can give me some pointers to boost my average.\u00a0I also want to congratulate the Class of 2009 for all your accomplishments. And since -- [Audience member interrupts with pro-life slogans]President Obama: And since -- this is Notre Dame, I mean --\u00a0That's...all right. And since --\u00a0[Audience chants \"We are ND! We are ND!\"]President Obama: We're fine, everybody. We're -- We're following Brennan's adage that we don't do things easily. We want to -- We're -- We're not going to shy away from things that are uncomfortable sometimes. Now, since -- since this is Notre Dame I think we should talk not only about your accomplishments in the classroom, but also in the competitive arena. No, don't worry, I'm not going to talk about that. We all know about this university's proud and storied football team, but I also hear that Notre Dame holds the largest outdoor 5-on-5 basketball tournament in the world -- \"Bookstore Basketball.\"Now this excites me. I want to congratulate the winners of this year's tournament, a team by the name of \"Hallelujah Holla Back.\" Congratulations. Well done. Though I have to say, I'm personally disappointed that the \"Barack O'Ballers\" did not pull it out this year. So next year, if you need a 6'2\" forward with a decent jumper, you know where I live.Now, every one of you should be proud of what you've achieved at this institution. One hundred and sixty-three classes of Notre Dame graduates have sat where you sit today. Some were here during years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare -- periods of relative peace and prosperity that required little by way of sacrifice or struggle.\u00a0You, however, are not getting off that easy. You have a different deal. Your class has come of age at a moment of great consequence for our nation and for the world -- a rare inflection point in history where the size and scope of the challenges before us require that we remake our world to renew its promise, that we align our deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age. It's a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations -- and a task that you're now called to fulfill.\u00a0This generation, your generation is the one that must find a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a global economy that left millions behind even before the most recent crisis hit -- an economy where greed and short-term thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness, and diligence, and an honest day's work.Your generation -- Your generation must decide how to save God's creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it. Your generation must seek peace at a time when there are those who will stop at nothing to do us harm, and when weapons in the hands of a few can destroy the many. And we must find a way to reconcile our ever-shrinking world with its ever-growing diversity -- diversity of thought, diversity of culture, and diversity of belief.In short, we must find a way to live together as one human family.And -- And it's this last challenge that I'd like to talk about today, despite the fact that Father John stole all my best lines. For the major threats we face in the 21st century -- whether it's global recession or violent extremism, the spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease -- these things do not discriminate. They do not recognize borders. They do not see color. They do not target specific ethnic groups. Moreover, no one person, or religion, or nation can meet these challenges alone. Our very survival has never required greater cooperation and greater understanding among all people from all places than at this moment in history.Unfortunately, finding that common ground -- recognizing that our fates are tied up, as Dr. King said, in a \"single garment of destiny\" -- is not easy. And part of the problem, of course, lies in the imperfections of man -- our selfishness, our pride, our stubbornness, our acquisitiveness, our insecurities, our egos -- all the cruelties large and small that those of us in the Christian tradition understand to be rooted in original sin. We too often seek advantage over others. We cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are unfamiliar. Too many of us view life only through the lens of immediate self-interest and crass materialism -- in which the world is necessarily a </p><p>zero-sum game. The strong too often dominate the weak, and too many of those with wealth and with power find all manner of justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty and injustice.And so for all our technology and scientific advances, we see here in this country and around the globe violence and want and strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient times. We know these things. And hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education that you have received here at Notre Dame is that you've had time to consider these wrongs in the world, perhaps recognized impulses in yourself that you want to leave behind. You've grown determined -- each in your own way -- to right them. And yet one of the vexing things for those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing together persons of good will, bringing together men and women of principle and purpose -- even accomplishing that can be difficult.The soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with equal passion, and yet reach very different conclusions on the specific steps needed to protect us from harm. The gay activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the ravages of HIV/AIDS, but find themselves unable to bridge the cultural divide that might unite their efforts. Those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in an admirable conviction about the sacredness of life, but so are the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son's or daughter's hardships might be relieved.The -- The question, then -- The question, then, is how do we work through these conflicts? Is it possible for us to join hands in common effort? As citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate? How does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without, as Father John said, demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side?\u00a0And of course, nowhere do these questions come up more powerfully than on the issue of abortion.As I considered the controversy surrounding my visit here, I was reminded of an encounter I had during my Senate campaign, one that I describe in a book I wrote called The Audacity of Hope. In a few days after I won the </p><p>Democratic nomination, I received an e-mail from a doctor who told me that while he voted for me in the Illinois primary, he had a serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in the general election. He described himself as a Christian who was strongly pro-life -- but that was not what was preventing him potentially from voting for me.\u00a0What bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign staff had posted on my website -- an entry that said I would fight, quote, \"right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose,\" unquote. The doctor said he had assumed I was a reasonable person. He supported my policy initiatives to help the poor and to lift up our educational system, but that if I truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women, then I was not very reasonable. He wrote, \"I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words.\"Fair-minded words.After I read the doctor's letter, I wrote back to him and I thanked him. And I didn't change my underlying position, but I did tell my staff to change the words on my website. And I said a prayer that night that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me; because when we do that -- when we open up our hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what we believe -- that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground. That's when we begin to say, \"Maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this heart-wrenching decision for any woman is not made casually, and it has both moral and spiritual dimensions.\u00a0So let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions. Let's reduce unintended pregnancies. Let's make adoption more available. Let's -- Let's provide care and support for women who do carry their children to term. Let's honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion, and draft a sensible conscience clause, and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded not only in sound science, but also in clear ethics, as well as respect for the equality of women. Those are things we can do.Now, understand -- understand, Class of 2009, I do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away, because no matter how much we may want to fudge it -- indeed, while we know that the views of most Americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory -- the fact is that at some level, the views of the two camps are irreconcilable. Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction. But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature.Open hearts. Open minds. Fair-minded words. It's a way of life that has always been the Notre Dame tradition. You know, Father -- Father Hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a -- a lighthouse and a crossroads, a lighthouse that stands apart, shining with the wisdom of the Catholic tradition, while the crossroads is where \"differences of culture and religion and conviction can co-exist with friendship, civility, hospitality, and especially love.\" And I want to join him and Father John in saying how inspired I am by the maturity and responsibility with which this class has approached the debate surrounding today's ceremony. You are an example of what Notre Dame is about. Now, this tradition of cooperation and understanding is one that I learned in my own life many years ago -- also with the help of the Catholic Church.\u00a0You see, I was not raised in a particularly religious household, but my mother instilled in me a sense of service and empathy that eventually led me to become a community organizer after I graduated college. And a group of Catholic churches in Chicago helped fund an organization known as the \"Developing Communities Project,\" and we worked to lift up South Side neighborhoods that had been devastated when the local steel plant closed.\u00a0And it was quite an eclectic crew -- Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish and African American organizers, working-class black, white, and Hispanic residents -- all of us with different experiences, all of us with different beliefs; but all of us learned to work side by side because all of us saw in these neighborhoods other human beings who needed our help to find jobs and improve schools. We were bound together in the service of others.And something else happened during the time I spent in these neighborhoods, perhaps because the church folks I worked with were so welcoming and understanding; perhaps because they invited me to their services and sang with me from their hymnals; perhaps because I was really broke and they fed me; perhaps because I witnessed all of the good works their faith inspired them to perform, I found myself drawn not just to the work with the church; I was drawn to be in the church. It was through this service that I was brought to Christ.\u00a0And at the time, </p><p>Cardinal Joseph Bernardin was the Archbishop of Chicago. And for those of you -- for those of you too young to have known him or known of him, he was a kind and good and wise man; a saintly man. I can still remember him speaking at one of the first organizing meetings I attended on the South Side. He stood as both a lighthouse and a crossroads -- unafraid to speak his mind on moral issues ranging from poverty and AIDS and abortion to the death penalty and nuclear war. And yet, he was congenial and gentle in his persuasion, always trying to bring people together, always trying to find common ground. And just before he died, a reporter asked Cardinal Bernardin about this approach to his ministry. And he said, \"You can't really get on with preaching the Gospel until you've touched hearts and minds.\"\u00a0My heart and mind were touched by him. They were touched by the words and deeds of the men and women I worked alongside in parishes across Chicago. And I'd like to think that we touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families whose lives we helped change. For this, I believe, is our highest calling.\u00a0Now, you, Class of 2009, are about to enter the next phase of your life at a time of great uncertainty. You'll be called to help restore a free market that's also fair to all who are willing to work. You'll be called to seek new sources of energy that can save our planet; to give future generations the same chance that you had to receive an extraordinary education. And whether as a person drawn to public service, or simply someone who insists on being an active citizen, you will be exposed to more opinions and ideas broadcast through more means of communication than ever existed before. You'll hear talking heads scream on cable; and you'll read blogs that claim definitive knowledge; and you will watch politicians pretend they know what they're talking about. Occasionally, you may have the great fortune of actually seeing important issues debated by people who do know what they're talking about -- by well-intentioned people with brilliant minds and mastery of the facts. In fact, I suspect that some of you will be among those brightest stars.\u00a0And in this world of competing claims about what is right and what is true, have confidence in the values with which you've been raised and educated. Be unafraid to speak your mind when those values are at stake. Hold firm to your faith and allow it to guide you on your journey. In other words, stand as a lighthouse. But remember, too, that you can be a crossroads. Remember, too, that the ultimate irony of faith is that it necessarily admits doubt. It's the belief in things not seen. It's beyond our capacity as human beings to know with certainty what God has planned for us or what He asks of us. And those of us who believe must trust that His wisdom is greater than our own.\u00a0And this doubt should not push us away our faith. But it should humble us. It should temper our passions, cause us to be wary of too much self-righteousness. It should compel us to remain open and curious and eager to continue the spiritual and moral debate that began for so many of you within the walls of Notre Dame. And within our vast democracy, this doubt should remind us even as we cling to our faith to persuade through reason, through an appeal, whenever we can, to universal rather than parochial principles, and most of all through an abiding example of good works and charity and kindness and service that moves hearts and minds.For if there is one law that we can be most certain of, it is the law that binds people of all faiths and no faith together. It's no coincidence that it exists in Christianity and Judaism, in Islam and Hinduism, in Buddhism and humanism. It is, of course, the Golden Rule -- the call to treat one another as we wish to be treated. The call to love. The call to serve. To do what we can to make a difference in the lives of those with whom we share the same brief moment on this Earth.So many of you at Notre Dame -- by the last count, upwards of 80 percent -- have lived this law of love through the service you've performed at schools and hospitals, international relief agencies and local charities. Brennan is just one example of what your class has accomplished. That's incredibly impressive, a powerful testament to this institution. And now -- now you must carry the tradition forward. Make it a way of life. Because when you serve, it doesn't just improve your community, it makes you a part of your community. It breaks down walls. It fosters cooperation. And when that happens -- when -- when people set aside their differences, even for a moment, to work in common effort toward a common goal; when they struggle together, and sacrifice together, and learn from one another -- then all things are possible.\u00a0After all, I stand here today, as President and as an African American, on the 55th anniversary of the day that the Supreme Court handed down the decision in </p><p></p><p>Brown versus Board of Education. Now, Brown was of course the first major step in dismantling the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. But it would take a number of years and a nationwide movement to fully realize the dream of civil rights for all of God's children. There were freedom rides and lunch counters and Billy clubs, and there was also a </p><p>Civil Rights Commission appointed by President Eisenhower. It was the 12 resolutions recommended by this commission that would ultimately become law in the </p><p>Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u00a0There were six members of this commission. It included five whites and one African American, Democrats and Republicans, two Southern governors, the dean of a Southern law school, a Midwestern university president, and your own Father Ted Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame. So they worked for two years, and at times President Eisenhower had to intervene personally since no hotel or restaurant in the South would serve the black and white members of the commission together. And finally when they reached an impasse in Louisiana, Father Ted flew them all to Notre Dame's retreat in Land O'Lakes, Wisconsin -- where they eventually -- where they eventually overcame their differences and hammered out a final deal.And years later, President Eisenhower asked Father Ted how on earth he was able to broker an agreement between men of such different backgrounds and beliefs. And Father Ted simply said that during their first dinner in Wisconsin they discovered they were all fishermen. And so he quickly readied a boat for a twilight trip out on the lake. They fished, and they talked, and they changed the course of history.\u00a0I will not pretend that the challenges we face will be easy, or that the answers will come quickly, or that all our differences and divisions will fade happily away -- because life is not that simple. It never has been.\u00a0But as you leave here today, remember the lessons of Cardinal Bernardin, of Father Hesburgh, of movements for change both large and small. Remember that each of us, endowed with the dignity possessed by all children of God, has the grace to recognize ourselves in one another; to understand that we all seek the same love of family, the same fulfillment of a life well lived. Remember that in the end, in some way we are all fishermen.\u00a0If nothing else, that knowledge should give us faith that through our collective labor, and God's providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, America will continue on its precious journey towards that more perfect union.

We've got our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta.\u00a0 We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates; Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney General Eric Holder; my National Security Advisor Jim Jones.\u00a0 And I want to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne Thomas.I also want to acknowledge several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence matters.\u00a0 I want to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, Congressman King, as well as Congressman Thompson, for being here today.\u00a0 Thank you so much.These are extraordinary times for our country.\u00a0 We're confronting a historic economic crisis.\u00a0 We're fighting two wars.\u00a0 We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21st century.\u00a0 So there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.And we've begun to make progress.\u00a0 Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely.\u00a0 The -- it's a good bill.\u00a0 The engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.\u00a0 I want to say to the members of Congress, I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues.In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as President is to keep the American people safe.\u00a0 It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning.\u00a0 It's the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night.And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.\u00a0 We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history.\u00a0 We know that al Qaeda is actively planning to attack us again.\u00a0 We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it.Already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.\u00a0 For the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u00a0 We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.\u00a0 We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.\u00a0 And we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.\u00a0 We're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.\u00a0 We're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.\u00a0 And we have renewed American diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world.These steps are all critical to keeping America secure.\u00a0 But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.\u00a0 The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.\u00a0 They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world.I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.\u00a0 My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.\u00a0 My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land.\u00a0 My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- \"to form a more perfect union.\"\u00a0 I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.\u00a0 I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.\u00a0 We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.\u00a0 Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval.Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government.It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty.From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law.\u00a0 That is who we are.\u00a0 And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology.After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.\u00a0 I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people.\u00a0 But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.\u00a0 Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.\u00a0 And during this season of fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.In other words, we went off course.\u00a0 And this is not my assessment alone.\u00a0 It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.Now let me be clear:\u00a0 We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.\u00a0 We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat.\u00a0 But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.\u00a0 For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.\u00a0 And that's why I took several steps upon taking office to better protect the American people.First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America.I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.\u00a0 I could not disagree more.\u00a0 As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence.\u00a0 I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.\u00a0 And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation.\u00a0 What's more, they undermine the rule of law.\u00a0 They alienate us in the world.\u00a0 They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America.\u00a0 They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.\u00a0 In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all.Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.\u00a0 As Senator McCain once said, torture \"serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.\"\u00a0 And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history.\u00a0 That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.\u00a0 They are not who we are, and they are not America.The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.\u00a0 During that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.\u00a0 Let me repeat that:\u00a0 three convictions in over seven years.\u00a0 Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the Supreme Court invalidated the entire system.\u00a0 Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from Guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.\u00a0 Let me repeat that:\u00a0 Two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo.There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world.\u00a0 Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law.\u00a0 In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected.\u00a0 Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause.\u00a0 Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.So the record is clear:\u00a0 Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security.\u00a0 It is a rallying cry for our enemies.\u00a0 It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.\u00a0 By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.\u00a0 That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why I ordered it closed within one year.The third decision that I made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.\u00a0 I knew when I ordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.\u00a0 There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo.\u00a0 In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.\u00a0 We're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country.Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.\u00a0 For example, the court order to release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place last fall, when George Bush was President.\u00a0 The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.\u00a0 In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open Guantanamo in the first place.\u00a0Now let me be blunt.\u00a0 There are no neat or easy answers here.\u00a0 I wish there were.\u00a0 But I can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.\u00a0 As President, I refuse to allow this problem to fester.\u00a0 I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.\u00a0 It is my responsibility to solve the problem.\u00a0 Our security interests will not permit us to delay.\u00a0 Our courts won't allow it.\u00a0 And neither should our conscience.Now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years.\u00a0 I'm an elected official; I understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.\u00a0 They should.\u00a0 We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face.\u00a0 But I have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.\u00a0 I'll leave that to others.\u00a0 I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans.And we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.\u00a0 Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.\u00a0 So I want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.\u00a0 I will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the American people and the values that we hold most dear.\u00a0 And I'll focus on two broad areas:\u00a0 first, issues relating to Guantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency.Now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:\u00a0 We are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endanger the American people.\u00a0 Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety.\u00a0As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face:\u00a0 Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.\u00a0 As Republican Lindsey Graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational.We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.\u00a0 And as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.\u00a0 That's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.\u00a0 Instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands.Now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories.First, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts -- courts provided for by the United States Constitution.\u00a0 Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists.\u00a0 They are wrong.\u00a0 Our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists.\u00a0 The record makes that clear.\u00a0 Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.\u00a0 He was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.\u00a0 Zacarias Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.\u00a0 He was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison.\u00a0 If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantanamo.Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion.\u00a0 We're preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District Court of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.\u00a0 Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction.\u00a0 And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions.\u00a0 Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back to George Washington and the Revolutionary War.\u00a0 They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war.\u00a0 They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts.Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.\u00a0 They should look at the record.\u00a0 In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.I said at that time, however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.\u00a0 Those are the reforms that we are now making.\u00a0 Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.\u00a0 We will no longer permit the use of evidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods.\u00a0 We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.\u00a0 And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify.\u00a0 These reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.The third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.\u00a0 Now, let me repeat what I said earlier:\u00a0 This has nothing to do with my decision to close Guantanamo.\u00a0 It has to do with the rule of law.\u00a0 The courts have spoken.\u00a0 They have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at Guantanamo.\u00a0 Nineteen of these findings took place before I was sworn into office.\u00a0 I cannot ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.\u00a0 The United States is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings.The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country.\u00a0 So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.\u00a0 And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation.Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people.\u00a0 And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.\u00a0 We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.\u00a0 But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.\u00a0 Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.\u00a0 These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.Let me repeat:\u00a0 I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people.\u00a0 Al Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.\u00a0 Having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.\u00a0 They can't be based simply on what I or the executive branch decide alone.\u00a0 That's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.\u00a0 We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.\u00a0 We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified.I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges. And other countries have grappled with this question; now, so must we.\u00a0 But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.\u00a0 Our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework.\u00a0 In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.\u00a0 If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.\u00a0 And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution.Now, as our efforts to close Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult.\u00a0 These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.\u00a0 You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.\u00a0 I get it.\u00a0 But if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.\u00a0 And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future.\u00a0I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing.\u00a0 I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution -- so did each and every member of Congress.\u00a0 And together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents to keep this country safe.Now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency.\u00a0National security requires a delicate balance.\u00a0 One the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency.\u00a0 On the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.\u00a0 In these and other cases, lives are at stake.Now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous administration's Office of Legal Counsel.\u00a0 I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and I didn't release the documents because I rejected their legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.\u00a0 I released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and I had already banned those methods.\u00a0 The argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense.\u00a0 We will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.\u00a0 That approach is now prohibited.In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.\u00a0 And the ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used.On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by U.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.\u00a0 Individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable.\u00a0 There was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.\u00a0 Nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.\u00a0 However, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war.In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.\u00a0 There are nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety as Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.Now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.\u00a0 They are not to me.\u00a0 In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security.\u00a0 And this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.\u00a0 There's no doubt that the American people have seen this balance tested over the last several years.\u00a0 In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before I was President, the American people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.\u00a0 And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.\u00a0 And that caused suspicion to build up.\u00a0 And that leads to a thirst for accountability.I understand that.\u00a0 I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.\u00a0 And that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.\u00a0 But I have never argued -- and I never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.\u00a0 I will never abandon -- and will vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe.\u00a0 Here's the difference though:\u00a0 Whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts.We're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.\u00a0 Because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- information.Now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the \"state secrets\" privilege.\u00a0 This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.\u00a0 It's been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for many decades.\u00a0 And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, I am concerned that it has been over-used.\u00a0 It is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits.\u00a0 So let me lay out some principles here.\u00a0 We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.\u00a0 And that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.And we plan to embrace several principles for reform.\u00a0 We will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.\u00a0 We will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and the personal approval of the Attorney General.\u00a0 And each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions.On all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had.\u00a0 There is not.\u00a0 These often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach.\u00a0 But the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple:\u00a0 We will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.\u00a0 I will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.\u00a0 I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.\u00a0 I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.Now, in all the areas that I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years.\u00a0 To protect the American people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.\u00a0 We are closing the prison at Guantanamo.\u00a0 We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists.\u00a0 We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.\u00a0 These are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.\u00a0 Their implementation will take time, but they will get done.There's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.\u00a0 Even as we clean up the mess at Guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public.\u00a0 We seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term.\u00a0 By doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next President and the President after that -- a legacy that protects the American people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad.Now, this is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future.\u00a0 I recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past.\u00a0 When it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high.\u00a0 Some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost.\u00a0 I know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission.I've opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.\u00a0 The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.\u00a0 The Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.\u00a0 And it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.\u00a0 But nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.\u00a0 Already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides to laying blame.\u00a0 It can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future.We see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.\u00a0 On the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency.\u00a0 And on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:\u00a0 \"Anything goes.\"\u00a0 Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a President with whom they agree.Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.\u00a0 The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.\u00a0 They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.\u00a0 That, after all, is the unique genius of America.\u00a0 That's the challenge laid down by our Constitution.\u00a0 That has been the source of our strength through the ages.\u00a0 That's what makes the United States of America different as a nation.I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.\u00a0 Make no mistake:\u00a0 If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as President.\u00a0 And if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall.The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years.\u00a0 But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through World War and Cold War, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way.\u00a0 It hasn't always been easy.\u00a0 We are an imperfect people.\u00a0 Every now and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.\u00a0 And we hear such voices today.\u00a0 But over the long haul the American people have resisted that temptation.\u00a0 And though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world.Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.\u00a0 And unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.\u00a0 Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.\u00a0 That will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.\u00a0 Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives.\u00a0 But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe.\u00a0 And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda.\u00a0 Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.\u00a0 This must be our common purpose.I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.\u00a0 We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.\u00a0 We've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours.\u00a0 We will do so once again.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates":

"<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio] Thank you so much. Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning; and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt's advancement.\u00a0And together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress.\u00a0I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'm also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country:\u00a0Assalaamu alaykum [Peace be upon you].We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate.\u00a0The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations.\u00a0Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam.Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of Muslims.\u00a0The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights.\u00a0All this has bred more fear and more mistrust.So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end.I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.\u00a0Instead, they overlap and share common principles -- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to this point.\u00a0But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground.\u00a0As the Holy Qur\u0092an tells us, \"Be conscious of God and speak always the truth.\" That is what I will try to do today -- to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.\u00a0 As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard thecall of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk.\u00a0 As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam.\u00a0It was Islam -- at places like Al-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment.\u00a0It was innovation in Muslim communities -- It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.\u00a0Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.\u00a0And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story.\u00a0The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco.\u00a0In signing the </p><p>Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President, John Adams, wrote, \"The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of Muslims.\"\u00a0And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States.\u00a0They have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civil rights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they've excelled in our sports arenas; they've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch.\u00a0 And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Qur\u0092an that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't.\u00a0And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.But, that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims -- Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire.\u00a0The United States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known.\u00a0We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders and around the world.\u00a0We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept:\u00a0E pluribus unum -- \"Out of many, one.\"Now much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique.\u00a0The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores -- and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the American average.Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion.\u00a0That is why there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within our borders.\u00a0 That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the </p><p>hijab -- and to punish those who would deny it.So let there be no doubt -- let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America.\u00a0And I believe that America holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share.\u00a0This is the hope of all humanity.Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.\u00a0Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.\u00a0These needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all.For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere.\u00a0When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk.\u00a0 When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations.\u00a0 When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean.\u00a0When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience.\u00a0That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.\u00a0That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings.And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace.\u00a0For human history has often been a record of nations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests.\u00a0Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating.\u00a0Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.\u00a0So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it.\u00a0Our problems must be dealt with through partnership; our progress must be shared. Now, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite:\u00a0 We must face these tensions squarely. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together.\u00a0The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject:\u00a0the killing of innocent men, women, and children.\u00a0And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people.The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together.\u00a0Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban with broad international support.\u00a0We did not go by choice; we went because of necessity. I'm aware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11.\u00a0But let us be clear:\u00a0Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day.\u00a0The victims were innocent men, women, and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody.\u00a0And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.Now, make no mistake:\u00a0We do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan.\u00a0We see no military -- We seek no military bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.\u00a0 It is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.\u00a0We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can.\u00a0But that is not yet the case.And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries.\u00a0And despite the costs involved, America's commitment will not weaken.\u00a0Indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists.\u00a0 They have killed in many countries.\u00a0They have killed people of different faiths. But more than any other, they have killed Muslims.\u00a0Their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam.\u00a0The Qur\u0092an teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as -- it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy Qur\u0092an also says whoever -- whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace.Now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u00a0That's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year over the next five years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced.\u00a0That's why we are providing more than 2.8 billion dollars to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on.Let me also address the issue of Iraq.\u00a0Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.\u00a0Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said:\u00a0\"I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.\"Today, America has a dual responsibility:\u00a0to help Iraq forge a better future; and to leave Iraq to Iraqis.\u00a0And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people -- I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources.\u00a0Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August.\u00a0That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. We will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy.\u00a0But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and never as a patron.And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles. Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals.\u00a0We are taking concrete actions to change course.\u00a0I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have </p><p>ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. So America will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law.\u00a0And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities which are also threatened.\u00a0The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians, and the Arab world.America's strong bonds with Israel are well known.\u00a0This bond is unbreakable. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.\u00a0Tomorrow, I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the </p><p>Third Reich.\u00a0Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; and it is hateful.\u00a0Threatening Israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews, is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- has suffered in pursuit of a homeland.\u00a0For more than 60 years they've endured the pain of dislocation.\u00a0Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead.\u00a0They endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation.\u00a0So let there be no doubt:\u00a0The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable.\u00a0And America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.For decades then, there has been a stalemate:\u00a0two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive.\u00a0It's easy to point fingers -- for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest. And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires. The obligations -- The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear. For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.Palestinians must abandon violence.\u00a0Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed.\u00a0For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.\u00a0But it was not violence that won full and equal rights.\u00a0It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding.\u00a0This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to Indonesia.\u00a0It's a story with a simple truth:\u00a0Violence is a dead end.\u00a0It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.\u00a0That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.\u00a0The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities.\u00a0To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist.At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.\u00a0The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.\u00a0It is time for these settlements to stop.And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society.\u00a0Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the </p><p>Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.\u00a0The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.\u00a0Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace.\u00a0But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away.\u00a0Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state.\u00a0It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.Too many tears have been shed.\u00a0Too much blood has been shed.\u00a0All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the </p><p>story of Isra -- as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer.The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u00a0For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.\u00a0In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.\u00a0Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.\u00a0This history is well known.\u00a0Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.\u00a0The question now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve.\u00a0There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect.\u00a0But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point.\u00a0This is not simply about America's interests.\u00a0It's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not.\u00a0No single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.\u00a0 And any nation -- including Iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the </p><p>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\u00a0That commitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.The fourth issue that I will address is democracy.I know -- I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq.\u00a0So let me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people.\u00a0Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people.\u00a0America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.\u00a0But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things:\u00a0the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose.\u00a0These are not just American ideas; they are human rights. And that is why we will support them everywhere.Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise.\u00a0But this much is clear:\u00a0Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure.\u00a0Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. America -- America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them.\u00a0And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments -- provided they govern with respect for all their people.This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others.\u00a0So no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power:\u00a0You must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.Thank you. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.\u00a0We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the </p><p>Inquisition.\u00a0I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country.\u00a0That is the spirit we need today.\u00a0People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.\u00a0This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of somebody else's faith.\u00a0The richness of religious diversity must be upheld -- whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. And if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among Muslims, as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together.\u00a0We must always examine the ways in which we protect it.\u00a0For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.\u00a0That's why I'm committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill </p><p>zakat. Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism. \u00a0 In fact, faith should bring us together.\u00a0And that's why we're forging service projects in America to bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\u00a0That's why we welcome efforts like Saudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance of Civilizations.\u00a0Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to action -- whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing relief after a natural disaster.\u00a0The sixth issue -- The sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights.I know --- I know -- and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue.\u00a0I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous. Now, let me be clear:\u00a0Issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam.\u00a0In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead.\u00a0Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of American life, and in countries around the world.I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons.\u00a0Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and women -- to reach their full potential.\u00a0I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. But it should be their choice. And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.\u00a0The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home.\u00a0Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change in communities.\u00a0In all nations -- including America -- this change can bring fear;\u00a0fear that because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith.But I also know that human progress cannot be denied.\u00a0There need not be contradictions between development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures.\u00a0The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.\u00a0In ancient times and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education.And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work.\u00a0Many Gulf states have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development.\u00a0But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too -- and in too many Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas.\u00a0I'm emphasizing such investment within my own country.\u00a0And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.On education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one that brought my father to America. At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create a new online network, so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo.On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in Muslim-majority countries.\u00a0And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in Muslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to -- to the marketplace so they can create more jobs.\u00a0We'll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops.\u00a0Today I'm announcing a new global effort with the </p><p>Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio.\u00a0And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child and maternal health.All these things must be done in partnership.\u00a0Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.Now the issues that I have described will not be easy to address.\u00a0But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's children are respected.\u00a0Those are mutual interests.\u00a0That is the world we seek.\u00a0But we can only achieve it together.I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this new beginning.\u00a0Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way of progress.\u00a0 Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.\u00a0There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.\u00a0But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country: You, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world. All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings.It's easier to start wars than to end them.\u00a0It's easier to blame others than to look inward.\u00a0It's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share.\u00a0But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.\u00a0There's one rule that lies at the heart of every religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian or Muslim or Jew.\u00a0It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world.\u00a0It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.The Holy Qur\u0092an tells us:\u00a0\"O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.\"The Talmud tells us: \"The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.\"The Holy Bible tells us: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\"\u00a0The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision.\u00a0Now that must be our work here on Earth.Thank you.\u00a0And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [31.2357116, 30.0444196]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Thuringia, Germany", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Speech at Buchenwald Concentration Camp", "article": "<p></p><p>Chancellor Merkel and I have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. Volkhard Knigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing. I am particularly grateful to be accompanied by my friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are survivors of this place.</p><p>We saw the area known as Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at the place that commemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunks along with the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, the foundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions.</p><p>We saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that is heated to 37 degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhuman because of their differences -- of the mark that we all share.</p><p>Now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking up, Elie said, \"if these trees could talk.\" And there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror that took place here.</p><p>More than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished. I will not forget what I've seen here today.</p><p>I've known about this place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very young man serving in World War II. He was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach a concentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps.</p><p>And I told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself for months on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head. And as we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed what had taken place here would be in a state of shock.</p><p>My great uncle's commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. He had seen the piles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when they arrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them or be able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way my great uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies had been taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it.</p><p>And that's why he ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp. He invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made. And he insisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could \"be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.\"</p><p>We are here today because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful. This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history.</p><p>Also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In this century, we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground; children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be ever vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering is not our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their own interests.</p><p>But as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're also reminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, we know that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who insisted on fasting on Yom Kippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellow inmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who organized a special effort to protect the children here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret classrooms, some of the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions. And we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistance was in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so out of the filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive.</p><p>When the American GIs arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and the youngest was just three years old. And I'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a Buchenwald song that many here sang. Among the lyrics were these: \"...whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we are free...in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts -- faith.\"</p><p>These individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place. They could not have known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearing their stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock tower set permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation.</p><p>They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own. And they could not have known that one day an American President would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing side by side with the German Chancellor in a Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued American ally.</p><p>They could not have known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast to life. In their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowable it arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them. And it is now up to us, the living, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem that faith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; to remember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us.</p><p>And just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember that the perpetrators of such evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want to express particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, because it's not easy to look into the past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will stand guard against acts like this happening again.</p><p>Rather than have me end with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel provide some reflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10.845346,

"<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Good afternoon.\u00a0 Thank you, President Sarkozy, Prime Minister Brown, Prime Minister Harper, and Prince Charles for being here today.\u00a0 Thank you to our Secretary of Veterans Affairs, General Eric Shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us.\u00a0 Thanks also to Susan Eisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge: \"Ok, let's go.\"\u00a0 And to a World War II veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proud and distinguished career as a United States Senator and a national leader:\u00a0 Bob Dole.</p><p>I'm not the first American President to come and mark this anniversary, and I likely will not be the last.\u00a0 This is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and grateful citizens; veterans and their loved ones; the liberated and their liberators.\u00a0 It's been written about and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches.\u00a0 And long after our time on this Earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men and women who will never meet the heroes who sit before us:\u00a0 D-Day.</p><p>Why is this?\u00a0 Of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does this day hold such a revered place in our memory?\u00a0 What is it about the struggle that took place on the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after year after year?</p><p>Part of it, I think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success.\u00a0 For three centuries, no invader had ever been able to cross the English Channel into Normandy.\u00a0 And it had never been more difficult than in 1944.</p><p>That was the year that Hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the Atlantic Wall against a seaborne invasion.\u00a0 From the tip of Norway to southern France, the Nazis lined steep cliffs with machine guns and artillery.\u00a0 Low-lying areas were flooded to block passage.\u00a0 Sharpened poles awaited paratroopers.\u00a0 Mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water.\u00a0 And by the time of the invasion, half a million Germans waited for the Allies along the coast between Holland and northern France.</p><p>At dawn on June 6th, the Allies came.\u00a0 The best chance for victory had been for the British Royal Air Corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behind enemy lines.\u00a0 But all did not go according to plan.\u00a0 Paratroopers landed miles from their mark, while the fog and clouds prevented Allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs.\u00a0 So when the ships landed here at Omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside.\u00a0 Many never made it out of the boats.</p><p>And yet, despite all of this, one by one, the Allied forces made their way to shore -- here, and at Utah and Juno; Gold and Sword.\u00a0 They were American, British, and Canadian.\u00a0 Soon, the paratroopers found each other and fought their way back.\u00a0 The Rangers scaled the cliffs.\u00a0 And by the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more.</p><p>The sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes D-Day so memorable.\u00a0 It also arises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged.</p><p>We live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true.\u00a0 It's a world of varied religions and cultures and forms of government.\u00a0 In such a world, it's all too rare for a struggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity.</p><p>The Second World War did that.\u00a0 No man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that war is good.\u00a0 But all know that this war was essential.\u00a0 For what we faced in Nazi totalitarianism was not just a battle of competing interests.\u00a0 It was a competing vision of humanity.\u00a0 Nazi ideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate.\u00a0 It perpetrated murder on a massive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior.\u00a0 It was evil.</p><p>The nations that joined together to defeat Hitler's Reich were not perfect.\u00a0 They had made their share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue.\u00a0 But whatever God we prayed to, whatever our differences, we knew that the evil we faced had to be stopped.\u00a0 Citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain as bystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction.\u00a0 And so we joined and sent our sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it is to be free.</p><p>In America, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action.\u00a0 A President who asked his country to pray on D-Day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasion possible.\u00a0 On farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month after month, year after year.\u00a0 Trucks and tanks came from plants in Michigan and Indiana, New York and Illinois.\u00a0 Bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in Ohio and Kansas, where my grandmother did her part as an inspector.\u00a0 Shipyards on both coasts produced the largest fleet in history, including the landing craft from New Orleans that eventually made it here to Omaha.</p><p>But despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders, the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from our home front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of one day in June.</p><p>Lyndon Johnson once said that there are certain moments when \"\u00bchistory and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.\"</p><p>D-Day was such a moment.\u00a0 One newspaper noted that \"we have come to the hour for which we were born.\"\u00a0 Had the Allies failed here, Hitler's occupation of this continent might have continued indefinitely.\u00a0 Instead, victory here secured a foothold in France.\u00a0 It opened a path to Berlin.\u00a0 It made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of Europe:\u00a0 the Marshall Plan, the NATO alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each.</p><p>It was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, on both sides of the Atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long and two miles wide.</p><p>More particularly, it came down to the men who landed here -- those who now rest in this place for eternity, and those who are with us here today.\u00a0 Perhaps more than any other reason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on D-Day.\u00a0 You're why we keep coming back.</p><p>For you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond our control.\u00a0 You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance.\u00a0 Our history has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by each individual man and woman.\u00a0 It has always been up to us.</p><p>You could have done what Hitler believed you would do when you arrived here.\u00a0 In the face of a merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore.\u00a0 Amid a barrage of tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes.\u00a0 You could have hid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall.\u00a0 You could have done only what was necessary to ensure your own survival.</p><p>But that's not what you did.\u00a0 That's not the story you told on D-Day.\u00a0 Your story was written by men like </p><p>Zane Schlemmer of the 82nd Airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, far from his objective and his men.\u00a0 Lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate the town in which he landed -- a town where a street now bears his name.</p><p>It's a story written by men like Anthony Ruggiero, an Army Ranger who saw half the men on his landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach.\u00a0 He spent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 Rangers to survive out of the 225 who were sent to scale the cliffs.</p><p>And it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like </p><p>Carlton Barrett.\u00a0 Private Barrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st Infantry Division, but he instead became one of its heroes.\u00a0 After wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the water again and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades.\u00a0 And under the heaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety.\u00a0 He carried them in his own arms.</p><p>This is the story of the Allied victory.\u00a0 It's the legend of units like Easy Company and the All-American 82nd.\u00a0 It's the tale of the British people, whose courage during the Blitz forced Hitler to call off the invasion of England; the Canadians, who came even though they were never attacked; the Russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the Eastern front; and all those French men and women who would rather have died resisting tyranny than lived within its grasp.</p><p>It is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice of a friend or relative.\u00a0 For me, it is my grandfather, </p><p>Stanley Dunham, who arrived on this beach six weeks after D-Day and marched across Europe in Patton's Army.\u00a0 And it is my great uncle who was part of the first American division to reach and liberate a Nazi concentration camp.\u00a0 His name is Charles Payne, and I'm so proud that he's with us here today.</p><p>I know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it, there's nothing that could keep you away.\u00a0 One such veteran, a man named </p><p>Jim Norene, was a member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Division of the 101st Airborne.\u00a0 Last night, after visiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep.\u00a0 Jim was gravely ill when he left his home, and he knew that he might not return.\u00a0 But just as he did 65 years ago, he came anyway.\u00a0 May he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his family always find solace in the heroism he showed here.</p><p>In the end, Jim Norene came back to Normandy for the same reason we all come back.\u00a0 He came for the reason articulated by Howard Huebner, another former paratrooper who is here with us today.\u00a0 When asked why he made the trip, Howard said, \"It's important that we tell our stories.\u00a0 It doesn't have to be something big\u00bcjust a little story about what happened -- so people don't forget.\"</p><p>So people don't forget.</p><p>Friends and veterans, we cannot forget.\u00a0 What we must not forget is that D-Day was a time and a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course of an entire century.\u00a0 At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary.\u00a0 They fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellow warriors they came to know as brothers.\u00a0 And they fought out of a simple sense of duty -- a duty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled for over two centuries.</p><p>That is the story of Normandy -- but also the story of America; of the Minutemen who gathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge at Gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.\u00a0 It's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives us hope.\u00a0 For as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hour for which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in history when the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachhead on an unforgiving shore.</p><p>To those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service.</p><p>May God bless you, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"},

Please, everybody, be seated. Thank you very much. You're very kind. Thank you. </p><p>Let me begin by thanking Nancy for the wonderful introduction. I want to thank Dr. Joseph Heyman, the chair of the Board of Trustees, as well as Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, speaker of House of Delegates. Thanks to all of you for bringing me home, even if it's just for a day.</p><p>From the moment I took office as President, the central challenge we've confronted as a nation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst recession since World War II. In recent months, we've taken a series of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediate damage to our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained growth. We're here to create new jobs, to unfreeze our credit markets. We're stemming the loss of homes and the decline of home values.</p><p>All this is important. But even as we've made progress, we know that the road to prosperity remains long and it remains difficult. And we also know that one essential step on our journey is to control the spiraling cost of health care in America. And in order to do that, we're going to need the help of the AMA.</p><p>Today, we are spending over $2 trillion a year on health care -- almost 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation. And yet, as I think many of you are aware, for all of this spending, more of our citizens are uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren't any healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend substantially less than we do are actually living longer than we do.</p><p>Make no mistake: The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It's an escalating burden on our families and businesses. It's a ticking time bomb for the federal budget. And it is unsustainable for the United States of America.</p><p>It's unsustainable for Americans like Laura Klitzka, a young mother that I met in Wisconsin just last week, who's learned that the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten had spread to her bones, but who's now being forced to spend time worrying about how to cover the $50,000 in medical debts she's already accumulated, worried about future debts that she's going to accumulate, when all she wants to do is spend time with her two children and focus on getting well. These are not the worries that a woman like Laura should have to face in a nation as wealthy as ours.</p><p>Stories like Laura's are being told by women and men all across this country -- by families who've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the last decade at a rate three times faster than wages. This is forcing Americans of all ages to go without the checkups or the prescriptions they need -- that you know they need. It's creating a situation where a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings.</p><p>Our costly health care system is unsustainable for doctors like Michael Kahn in New Hampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day supervising a staff explaining insurance problems to patients, completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters -- a routine that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do what he became a doctor to do and actually care for his patients.</p><p>Small business owners like Chris and Becky Link in Nashville are also struggling. They've always wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run marketing firm, but they've recently had to do the unthinkable and lay off a number of employees -- layoffs that could have been deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high. Across the country, over one-third of small businesses have reduced benefits in recent years and one-third have dropped their workers' coverage altogether since the early '90s.</p><p>Our largest companies are suffering, as well. A big part of what led General Motors and Chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing health care for their workers -- costs that made them less profitable and less competitive with automakers around the world. If we do not fix our health care system, America may go the way of GM -- paying more, getting less, and going broke.</p><p>When it comes to the cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable. So reform is not a luxury; it is a necessity. When I hear people say, well, why are you taking this on right now, you've got all these other problems, I keep on reminding people I'd love to be able to defer these issues, but we can't. I know there's been much discussion about what reform would cost, and rightly so. This is a test of whether we -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.</p><p>But let there be no doubt -- the cost of inaction is greater. If we fail to act -- if we fail to act -- and you know this because you see it in your own individual practices -- if we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans -- all of which will affect your practice.</p><p>If we fail to act, one out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care within a decade. And in 30 years, it will be about one out of every three -- a trend that will mean lost jobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for all Americans.</p><p>And if we fail to act, federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare will grow over the coming decades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on our nation's defense. It will, in fact, eventually grow larger than what our government spends on anything else today. It's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state budgets, and impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, or overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our federal and state budgets.</p><p>So to say it as plainly as I can, health care is the single most important thing we can do for America's long-term fiscal health. That is a fact. That's a fact.</p><p>It's a fact, and the truth is most people know that it's a fact. And yet, as clear as it is that our system badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable. There's a sense out there among some, and perhaps some members who are gathered here today of the AMA, that as bad as our current system may be -- and it's pretty bad -- the devil we know is better than the devil we don't. There's a fear of change -- a worry that we may lose what works about our health care system while trying to fix what doesn't.</p><p>I'm here to tell you I understand that fear. And I understand the cynicism. They're scars left over from past efforts at reform. After all, Presidents have called for health care reform for nearly a century. Teddy Roosevelt called for it. Harry Truman called for it. Richard Nixon called for it. Jimmy Carter called for it. Bill Clinton called for it. But while significant individual reforms have been made -- such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program -- efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs have largely failed.</p><p>Part of the reason is because the different groups involved -- doctors, insurance companies, businesses, workers, and others -- simply couldn't agree on the need for reform or what shape it would take. And if we're honest, another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists -- opposition that has used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to, yes, socialize medicine.</p><p>And despite this long history of failure, I'm standing here because I think we're in a different time. One sign that things are different is that just this past week, the Senate passed a bill that will protect children from the dangers of smoking, a reform the AMA has long championed -- this organization long championed; it went nowhere when it was proposed a decade ago -- I'm going to sign this into law. </p><p>Now, what makes this moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- key stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform. They're coming out -- they're coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community to do their part -- everybody is going to have to pitch in -- ultimately, everybody will benefit.</p><p>And I want to commend the AMA, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs and achieve reform. Just a week ago, you joined together with hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers and drug companies to do something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago -- you promised to work together to cut national health care spending by $2 trillion over the next decade, relative to what it would have otherwise been. And that will bring down costs; that will bring down premiums. That's exactly the kind of cooperation we need, and we appreciate that very much. Thank you.</p><p>Now, the question is how do we finish the job? How do we permanently bring down costs and make quality, affordable health care available to every single American? That's what I've come to talk about today. We know the moment is right for health care reform. We know this is a historic opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again. But we also know that there are those who will try and scuttle this opportunity no matter what -- who will use the same scare tactics and fear-mongering that's worked in the past; who will give warnings about socialized medicine and government takeovers, long lines and rationed care, decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors. We have heard this all before. And because these fear tactics have worked, things have kept getting worse.</p><p>So let me begin by saying this to you and to the American people: I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what. My view is that health care reform should be guided by a simple principle: Fix what's broken and build on what works. And that's what we intend to do.</p><p>If we do that, we can build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead of administrators and accountants; a system that gives Americans -- a system that gives Americans the best care at the lowest cost; a system that eases up the pressure on businesses and unleashes the promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our economy by tens of billions of dollars more every year. That's how we'll stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, and start investing those dollars in innovations and advances that will make our health care system and our economy stronger.</p><p>That's what we can do with this opportunity. And that's what we must do with this moment.</p><p>Now, the good news is that in some instances, there's already widespread agreement on the steps necessary to make our health care system work better.</p><p>First, we need to upgrade our medical records by switching from a paper to an electronic system of record keeping. And we've already begun to do this with an investment we made as part of our Recovery Act.</p><p>It simply doesn't make sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms with pens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere. As Newt Gingrich has rightly pointed out -- and I don't quote Newt Gingrich that often -- we do a better job tracking a FedEx package in this country than we do tracking patients' health records.</p><p>You shouldn't have to tell every new doctor you see about your medical history or what prescriptions you're taking. You shouldn't have to repeat costly tests. All that information should be stored securely in a private medical record so that your information can be tracked from one doctor to another -- even if you change jobs, even if you move, even if you have to see a number of different specialists. That's just common sense.</p><p>And that will not only mean less paper-pushing and lower administrative costs, saving taxpayers billions of dollars; it will also mean all of you physicians will have an easier time doing your jobs. It will tell you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoid prescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction. It will prevent the wrong dosages from going to a patient. It will reduce medical errors, it's estimated, that lead to 100,000 lives lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year.</p><p>So there shouldn't be an argument there. And we want to make sure that we're helping providers computerize so that we can get this system up and running.</p><p>The second step that we can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so we can avoid illness and disease in the first place. That starts with each of us taking more responsibility for our health and for the health of our children. It means quitting smoking. It means going in for that mammogram or colon cancer screening. It means going for a run or hitting the gym, and raising our children to step away from the video games and spend more time playing outside.</p><p>It also means cutting down on all the junk food that's fueling an epidemic of obesity -- which puts far too many Americans, young and old, at greater risk of costly, chronic conditions. That's a lesson Michelle and I have tried to instill in our daughters. As some of you know, we started a White House vegetable garden. I say \"we\" generously, because Michelle has done most of the work. That's a lesson that we should work with local school districts to incorporate into their school lunch programs.</p><p>Building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases will require all of us to do our parts. It will take doctors telling us what risk factors we should avoid and what preventive measures we should pursue. It will take employers following the example of places like Safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care of their health while reducing health care costs in the process.</p><p>If you're one of three-quarters of Safeway workers enrolled in their \"Healthy Measures\" program, you can get screened for problems like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. And if you score well, you can pay lower premiums; you get more money in your paycheck. It's a program that has helped Safeway cut health care spending by 13 percent, and workers save over 20 percent on their premiums. And we're open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs like this one.</p><p>Our federal government also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy living. Five of the costliest illnesses and conditions -- cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, and strokes -- can be prevented. And yet only a fraction of every health care dollar goes to prevention or public health. And that's starting to change with an investment we're making in prevention and wellness programs that can help us avoid disease that harm our health and the health of our economy.</p><p>But as important as they are, investments in electronic records and preventive care, all the things that I've just mentioned, they're just preliminary steps. They will only make a dent in the epidemic of rising costs in this country.</p><p>Despite what some have suggested, the reason we have these spiraling costs is not simply because we've got an aging population; demographics do account for part of rising costs because older, sicker societies pay more on health care than younger, healthier ones, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong in us taking better care of ourselves. But what accounts for the bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care delivery system itself -- a system where we spend vast amounts of money on things that aren't necessarily making our people any healthier; a system that automatically equates more expensive care with better care.</p><p>Now, a recent article in the New Yorker, for example, showed how McAllen, Texas, is spending twice as much as El Paso County -- twice as much -- not because people in McAllen, Texas, are sicker than they are in El Paso; not because they're getting better care or getting better outcomes. It's simply because they're using more treatments -- treatments that, in some cases, they don't really need; treatments that, in some cases, can actually do people harm by raising the risk of infection or medical error.</p><p>And the problem is this pattern is repeating itself across America. One Dartmouth study shows that you're less likely -- you're no less likely to die from a heart attack and other ailments in a higher-spending area than in a lower-spending one.</p><p>There are two main reasons for this. The first is a system of incentives where the more tests and services are provided, the more money we pay. And a lot of people in this room know what I'm talking about. It's a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care; that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each, and gives you every incentive to order that extra MRI or EKG, even if it's not necessary. It's a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- a calling -- to a business.</p><p>That's not why you became doctors. That's not why you put in all those hours in the Anatomy Suite or the O.R. That's not what brings you back to a patient's bedside to check in, or makes you call a loved one of a patient to say it will be fine. You didn't enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers. You entered this profession to be healers. And that's what our health care system should let you be. That's what this health care system should let you be. </p><p></p><p>Now, that starts with reforming the way we compensate our providers -- doctors and hospitals. We need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every single treatment you offer a patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, but instead paid well for how you treat the overall disease. We need to create incentives for physicians to team up, because we know that when that happens, it results in a healthier patient. We need to give doctors bonuses for good health outcomes, so we're not promoting just more treatment, but better care.</p><p>And we need to rethink the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medical students who choose a career as a primary care physician -- who choose to work in underserved areas instead of the more lucrative paths. That's why we're making a substantial investment in the National Health Service Corps that will make medical training more affordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they aren't drowning in debt when they enter the workforce. Somebody back there is drowning in debt.</p><p>The second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical information making its way to doctors and patients. We have the best medical schools, the most sophisticated labs, the most advanced training of any nation on the globe. Yet we're not doing a very good job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of better medicine.</p><p>Less than 1 percent of our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most effective -- less than 1 percent. And even when that information finds its way into journals, it can take up to 17 years to find its way to an exam room or operating table. As a result, too many doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the latest research.</p><p>A recent study, for example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based on scientific evidence -- half. That means doctors may be doing a bypass operation when placing a stent is equally effective; or placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drug and medical management is equally effective -- all of which drives up costs without improving a patient's health.</p><p>So one thing we need to do is to figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementation of what works into your practices. That's why we're making a major investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions.</p><p>Now, let me be clear -- I just want to clear something up here -- identifying what works is not about dictating what kind of care should be provided. It's about providing patients and doctors with the information they need to make the best medical decisions. See, I have the assumption that if you have good information about what makes your patients well, that's what you're going to do. I have confidence in that. We're not going to need to force you to do it. We just need to make sure you've got the best information available.</p><p>Still, even when we do know what works, we are often not making the most of it. And that's why we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at places like the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where the quality of care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after the hospital began incorporating suggestions from parents. And places like Tallahassee Memorial Health Care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with rapid response teams that monitored patients' conditions, and \"multidisciplinary rounds\" with everyone from physicians to pharmacists. And places like Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, and Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, where high-quality care is being provided at a cost well below the national average. These are all islands of excellence that we need to make the standard in our health care system.</p><p>So replicating best practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities -- any legislation sent to my desk that does not these -- does not achieve these goals in my mind does not earn the title of reform.</p><p>But my signature on a bill is not enough. I need your help, doctors, because to most Americans you are the health care system. The fact is Americans -- and I include myself and Michelle and our kids in this -- we just do what you tell us to do. That's what we do. We listen to you, we trust you. And that's why I will listen to you and work with you to pursue reform that works for you. </p><p>Together, if we take all these steps, I am convinced we can bring spending down, bring quality up; we can save hundreds of billions of dollars on health care costs while making our health care system work better for patients and doctors alike. And when we align the interests of patients and doctors, then we're going to be in a good place.</p><p>Now, I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. I recognize that. Don't get too excited yet. Now, I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable. That's a real issue. Now, just hold on to your horses here, guys. I want to be honest with you. I'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards -- which I personally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed.</p><p>But I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first; how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine; how to encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines. I want to work with the AMA so we can scale back the excessive defensive medicine that reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we are providing better care, simply -- rather than simply more treatment.</p><p>So this is going to be a priority for me. And I know, based on your responses, it's a priority for you. And I look forward to working with you. And it's going to be difficult. But all this stuff is going to be difficult. All of it's going to be important.</p><p>Now, I know this has been a long speech, but we got more to do. The changes that I have already spoken about, all that is going to need to go hand-in-hand with other reforms. Because our health care system is so complex and medicine is always evolving, we need a way to continually evaluate how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality.</p><p>That's why I'm open to expanding the role of a commission created by a Republican Congress called the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which happens to include a number of physicians on the commission. In recent years, this commission proposed roughly $200 billion in savings that never made it into law. These recommendations have now been incorporated into our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their proposals, the commission's proposals, in the future so that we don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars, as we gain more information about what works and what doesn't work in our health care system.</p><p>And as we seek to contain the cost of health care, we also have to ensure that every American can get coverage they can afford. We must do so in part because it's in all of our economic interests. Each time an uninsured American steps foot into an emergency room with no way to reimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every American family as a bill of about $1,000 that's reflected in higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs. It's a hidden tax, a hidden bill that will be cut as we insure all Americans. And as we insure every young and healthy American, it will spread out risk for insurance companies, further reducing costs for everyone.</p><p>But alongside these economic arguments, there's another, more powerful one. And it is simply this: We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women and children. We are not a nation that lets hardworking families go without coverage, or turns its back on those in need. We're a nation that cares for its citizens. We look out for one another. That's what makes us the United States of America. We need to get this done.</p><p>So we need to do a few things to provide affordable health insurance to every single American. The first thing we need to do is to protect what's working in our health care system. So just in case you didn't catch it the first time, let me repeat: If you like your health care system and your doctor, the only thing reform will mean to you is your health care will cost less. If anyone says otherwise, they are either trying to mislead you or don't have their facts straight.</p><p>Now, if you don't like your health care coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance, under what we've proposed, to take part in what we're calling a Health Insurance Exchange. This exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family -- the same way, by the way, that federal employees can do, from a postal worker to a member of Congress. You will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package.</p><p>Again, this is for people who aren't happy with their current plan. If you like what you're getting, keep it. Nobody is forcing you to shift. But if you're not, this gives you some new options. And I believe one of these options needs to be a public option that will give people a broader range of choices -- and inject competition into the health care market so that force -- so that we can force waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest.</p><p>Now, I know that there's some concern about a public option. Even within this organization there's healthy debate about it. In particular, I understand that you're concerned that today's Medicare rates, which many of you already feel are too low, will be applied broadly in a way that means our cost savings are coming off your backs.</p><p>And these are legitimate concerns, but they're ones, I believe, that can be overcome. As I stated earlier, the reforms we propose to reimbursement are to reward best practices, focus on patient care, not on the current piecework reimbursements. What we seek is more stability and a health care system that's on a sounder financial footing.</p><p>And the fact is these reforms need to take place regardless of whether there's a public option or not. With reform, we will ensure that you are being reimbursed in a thoughtful way that's tied to patient outcomes, instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the Sustainable Growth Rate formula that's based on politics and the immediate state of the federal budget in any given year.</p><p>And I just want to point out the alternative to such reform is a world where health care costs grow at an unsustainable rate. And if you don't think that's going to threaten your reimbursements and the stability of our health care system, you haven't been paying attention.</p><p>So the public option is not your enemy; it is your friend, I believe.</p><p>Let me also say that -- let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward by those who are claiming that a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payer system. I'll be honest; there are countries where a single-payer system works pretty well. But I believe -- and I've taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief -- that it's important for our reform efforts to build on our traditions here in the United States. So when you hear the naysayers claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this: They're not telling the truth.</p><p>What I am trying to do -- and what a public option will help do -- is put affordable health care within reach for millions of Americans. And to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it. That way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured.</p><p>Indeed, it's because I'm confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance at an affordable rate that I'm open to a system where every American bears responsibility for owning health insurance -- so long as we provide a hardship waiver for those who still can't afford it as we move towards this system.</p><p>The same is true for employers. While I believe every business has a responsibility to provide health insurance for its workers, small businesses that can't afford it should receive an exemption. And small business workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in the exchange if their employer is not able to provide it.</p><p>Now, here's some good news. Insurance companies have expressed support for the idea of covering the uninsured and they certainly are in favor of a mandate. I welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform debate. I'm glad they're at the table. But what I refuse to do is simply create a system where insurance companies suddenly have a whole bunch of more customers on Uncle Sam's dime, but still fail to meet their responsibilities. We're not going to do that.</p><p>Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. We need to end the practice of denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. The days of cherry-picking who to cover and who to deny, those days are over. I know you see it in your practices, and how incredibly painful and frustrating it is -- you want to give somebody care and you find out that the insurance companies are wiggling out of paying.</p><p>This is personal for me also. I've told this story before. I'll never forget watching my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final days, spending time worrying about whether her insurer would claim her illness was a preexisting condition so it could get out of providing coverage. Changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least we can do -- for my mother and for every other mother, father, son, and daughter, who has suffered under this practice, who've been paying premiums and don't get care. We need to put health care within the reach for millions of Americans.</p><p>Now, even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordable coverage to all Americans, there is no denying that expanding coverage will come at a cost, at least in the short run. But it is a cost that will not -- I repeat -- will not add to our deficits. I've set down a rule for my staff, for my team -- and I've said this to Congress -- health care reform must be, and will be, deficit-neutral in the next decade.</p><p>Now, there are already voices saying the numbers don't add up. They're wrong. Here's why. Making health care affordable for all Americans will cost somewhere on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That's real money, even in Washington. But remember, that's less than we are projected to have spent on the war in Iraq. And also remember, failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages.</p><p>That said, let me explain how we will cover the price tag. First, as part of the budget that was passed a few months ago, we put aside $635 billion over 10 years in what we're calling a Health Reserve Fund. Over half of that amount -- more than $300 billion -- will come from raising revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions the wealthiest Americans can take to the same level that it was at the end of the Reagan years -- same level that it was under Ronald Reagan. Some are concerned that this will dramatically reduce charitable giving, for example, but statistics show that's not true. And the best thing for our charities is the stronger economy that we will build with health care reform.</p><p>But we can't just raise revenues. We're also going to have to make spending cuts, in part by examining inefficiencies in our current Medicare program. There are going to be robust debates about where these cuts should be made, and I welcome that debate. But here's where I think these cuts should be made.</p><p>First, we should end overpayments to Medicare Advantage. Today, we're paying Medicare Advantage plans much more than we pay for traditional Medicare services. Now, this is a good deal for insurance companies. It's a subsidy to insurance companies. It's not a good deal for you. It's not a good deal for the American people. And by the way, it doesn't follow free market principles, for those who are always talking about free market principles. That's why we need to introduce competitive bidding into the Medicare Advantage program, a program under which private insurance companies are offering Medicare coverage. That alone will save $177 billion over the next decade, just that one step.</p><p>Second, we need to use Medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospital readmissions. Right now, almost 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals are readmitted within a month, often because they're not getting the comprehensive care that they need. This puts people at risk; it drives up cost. By changing how Medicare reimburses hospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts profits but drives up costs for everyone else. That will save us $25 billion over the next decade.</p><p>Third, we need to introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace.These are drugs used to treat illnesses like anemia. But right now, there is no pathway at the FDA for approving generic versions of these drugs. Creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars. We can save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our poorer seniors while asking our well-off seniors to pay a little more for their drugs.</p><p>So that's the bulk of what's in the Health Reserve Fund. I've also proposed saving another $313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending in several other ways. One way is by adjusting Medicare payments to reflect new advances and productivity gains in our economy. Right now, Medicare payments are rising each year by more than they should. These adjustments will create incentives for providers to deliver care more efficiently, and save us roughly $109 billion in the process.</p><p>Another way we can achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treating uninsured people. I know hospitals rely on these payments now, legitimately, because of the large number of uninsured patients that they treat. But if we put in a system where people have coverage and the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the amount we pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as well. Reducing these payments gradually, as more and more people have coverage, will save us over $106 billion. And we'll make sure the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most.</p><p>We can also save about $75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs. And we can save about $1 billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, fraud throughout our health care system so that no one is charging more for a service than it's worth or charging a dime for a service that they don't provide.</p><p>Let me be clear: I'm committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior citizens. In fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by seven years, and reduce premiums for Medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over the next 10 years. And I'm working with AARP to uphold that commitment.</p><p>Now, for those of you who took out your pencil and paper -- altogether, these savings mean that we've put about $950 billion on the table -- and that doesn't count some of the long-term savings that we think will come about from reform -- from medical IT, for example, or increased investment in prevention. So that stuff in congressional jargon is not scorable; the Congressional Budget Office won't count that as savings, so we're setting that aside. We think that's going to come, but even separate and far from that, we've put $950 billion on the table, taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of health care reform.</p><p>In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to working with Congress to make up the difference so that health care reform is fully paid for -- in a real, accountable way. And let me add that this does not count longer-term savings. I just want to repeat that. By insisting that the reforms that we're introducing are deficit-neutral over the next decade, and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth rate of health care costs over the coming decades -- bending the curve -- we can look forward to faster economic growth, higher living standards, and falling, instead of rising, budget deficits.</p><p>Now, let me just wrap up by saying this. I know people are cynical whether we can do this or not. I know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the days ahead. There's probably healthy debate within the AMA. That's good. I also know this: We can't let this moment pass us by.</p><p>You know, the other day, a friend of mine, Congressman Earl Blumenauer, handed me a magazine with a special issue titled, \"The Crisis in American Medicine.\" One article notes \"soaring charges.\" Another warns about the \"volume of utilization of services.\" Another asks if we can find a \"better way than fee-for-service for paying for medical care.\" It speaks to many of the challenges we face today. The thing is, this special issue was published by Harper's Magazine in October of 1960 -- before I was born.</p><p>Members of the American Medical Association, and my fellow Americans, I'm here today because I don't want our children and their children to still be speaking of a crisis in American medicine 50 years from now. I don't want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs that we did not stem, or sicknesses that we did not cure. I don't want them to be burdened with massive deficits we did not curb or a worsening economy that we did not rebuild.</p><p>I want them to benefit from a health care system that works for all of us; where families can open a doctor's bill without dreading what's inside; where parents are talking to their kids and getting them to get regular checkups, and testing themselves for preventable ailments; where parents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are exercising more; where patients are spending more time with their doctors, and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medical information and latest research they'll ever want to know to meet patients' needs; where orthopedists and nephrologists and oncologists are all working together to treat a single human being; where what's best about America's health care system has become the hallmark of America's health care system.</p><p>That's the health care system we can build. That's the future I'm convinced is within our reach. And if we're willing to come together and bring about that future, then we will not only make Americans healthier, we will not only unleash America's economic potential, but we will reaffirm the ideals that led you into this noble profession and we'll build a health care system that lets all Americans heal.</p><p>Thank you very much, AMA.

I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs.

And we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations are patently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about the people of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose.The Iranian people can speak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days. In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing.This is what we've witnessed. We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets. While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history.As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's own people are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government.Now, the second issue I want to address is our ongoing effort to build a clean energy economy.This week, the House of Representatives is moving ahead on historic legislation that will transform the way we produce and use energy in America. This legislation will spark a clean energy transformation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbon pollution that threatens our planet.This energy bill will create a set of incentives that will spur the development of new sources of energy, including wind, solar, and geothermal power. It will also spur new energy savings, like efficient windows and other materials that reduce heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer.These incentives will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy. And that will lead to the development of new technologies that lead to new industries that could create millions of new jobs in America -- jobs that can't be shipped overseas.At a time of great fiscal challenges, this legislation is paid for by the polluters who currently emit the dangerous carbon emissions that contaminate the water we drink and pollute the air that we breathe. It also provides assistance to businesses and communities as they make the gradual transition to clean energy technologies.So I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important for our country; it's taken great effort on the part of many over the course of the past several months. And I want to thank the Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Henry Waxman; his colleagues on that committee, including Congressmen Dingell, Ed Markey, and Rick Boucher. I also want to thank Charlie Rangel, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and Collin Peterson, the Chair of the Agriculture Committee, for their many and ongoing contributions to this process. And I want to express my appreciation to Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer for their leadership.We all know why this is so important. The nation that leads in the creation of a clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the 21st century's global economy. That's what this legislation seeks to achieve -- it's a bill that will open the door to a better future for this nation. And that's why I urge members of Congress to come together and pass it.The last issue I'd like to address is health care.Right now, Congress is debating various health care reform proposals. This is obviously a complicated issue, but I am very optimistic about the progress that they're making.Like energy, this is legislation that must and will be paid for. It will not add to our deficits over the next decade. We will find the money through savings and efficiencies within the health care system -- some of which we've already announced.We will also ensure that the reform we pass brings down the crushing cost of health care. We simply can't have a system where we throw good money after bad habits. We need to control the skyrocketing costs that are driving families, businesses, and our government into greater and greater debt.There's no doubt that we must preserve what's best about our health care system, and that means allowing Americans who like their doctors and their health care plans to keep them. But unless we fix what's broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Unless we act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, and the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans. Unless we act, one out of every five dollars that we earn will be spent on health care within a decade. And the amount our government spends on Medicare and Medicaid will eventually grow larger than what our government spends on everything else today.When it comes to health care, the status Q: uo is unsustainable and unacceptable. So reform is not a luxury, it's a necessity. And I hope that Congress will continue to make significant progress on this issue in the weeks ahead.So let me open it up for questions, and I'll start with you, Jennifer.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Your administration has said that the offer to talk to Iran's leaders remains open. Can you say if that's still so, even with all the violence that has been committed by the government against the peaceful protesters? And if it is, is there any red line that your administration won't cross where that offer will be shut off?President Obama: Well, obviously what's happened in Iran is profound. And we're still waiting to see how it plays itself out. My position coming into this office has been that the United States has core national security interests in making sure that Iran doesn't possess a nuclear weapon and it stops exporting terrorism outside of its borders.We have provided a path whereby Iran can reach out to the international community, engage, and become a part of international norms. It is up to them to make a decision as to whether they choose that path. What we've been seeing over the last several days, the last couple of weeks, obviously is not encouraging, in terms of the path that this regime may choose to take. And the fact that they are now in the midst of an extraordinary debate taking place in Iran may end up coloring how they respond to the international community as a whole.We are going to monitor and see how this plays itself out before we make any judgments about how we proceed. But just to reiterate, there is a path available to Iran in which their sovereignty is respected, their traditions, their culture, their faith is respected, but one in which they are part of a larger community that has responsibilities and operates according to norms and international rules that are universal. We don't know how they're going to respond yet, and that's what we're waiting to see.Q: So should there be consequences for what's happened so far?President Obama: I think that the international community is, as I said before, bearing witness to what's taking place. And the Iranian government should understand that how they handle the dissent within their own country, generated indigenously, internally, from the Iranian people, will help shape the tone not only for Iran's future but also its relationship to other countries.Since we're on Iran, I know Nico Pitney is here from Huffington Post.Q: Thank you, Mr. President.President Obama: Nico, I know that you, and all across the Internet, we've been seeing a lot of reports coming directly out of Iran. I know that there may actually be Questions from people in Iran who are communicating through the Internet. Do you have a question?Q: Yes, I did, I wanted to use this opportunity to ask you a question directly from an Iranian. We solicited questions last night from people who are still courageous enough to be communicating online, and one of them wanted to ask you this: Under which conditions would you accept the election of Ahmadinejad? And if you do accept it without any significant changes in the conditions there, isn't that a betrayal of what the demonstrators there are working towards?President Obama: Well, look, we didn't have international observers on the ground. We can't say definitively what exactly happened at polling places throughout the country. What we know is that a sizeable percentage of the Iranian people themselves, spanning Iranian society, consider this election illegitimate. It's not an isolated instance -- a little grumbling here or there. There is significant questions about the legitimacy of the election.And so ultimately the most important thing for the Iranian government to consider is legitimacy in the eyes of its own people, not in the eyes of the United States. And that's why I've been very clear: Ultimately, this is up to the Iranian people to decide who their leadership is going to be and the structure of their government.What we can do is to say unequivocally that there are sets of international norms and principles about violence, about dealing with peaceful dissent, that spans cultures, spans borders. And what we've been seeing over the Internet and what we've been seeing in news reports violates those norms and violates those principles.I think it is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and legitimacy and prosperity for the Iranian people. We hope they take it.Jeff Mason of Reuters.Q: Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial regulation and reform that you have made, how do you rate the performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis? And more specifically, how do you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you like him to stay on when his term ends in January?President Obama: I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke -- although I think he has done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps where there were laws on the books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis; the enforcement wasn't there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books -- for example, with the non-banking sector.I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things that we're putting a huge amount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer protection -- whether it's subprime loans that were given out because nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled to consumers, whether it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, what people can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that's why we said we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those issues.Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.Q: But is the Fed getting too powerful?President Obama: If you look at what we've proposed, we are not so much expanding the Fed's power as we are focusing what the Fed needs to do to prevent the kinds of crises that are happening again. Another good example is the issue of resolution authority. I think it wasn't that long ago where everybody was properly outraged about AIG, and the enormous amounts of money the taxpayers had to put into AIG in order to prevent it from dragging the entire financial system down with it.Had we had the kinds of resolution authority, the kinds of laws that were in place that would allow a orderly winding down of AIG, then potentially taxpayers could have saved a huge amount of money. We want that power to be available so that taxpayers aren't on the hook.All right? Major Garrett. Where's Major?Q: Right here, sir. In your opening remarks, sir, you were -- you said about Iran that you were appalled and outraged. What took you so long to say those words?President Obama: I don't think that's accurate. Track what I've been saying. Right after the election, I said that we had profound concerns about the nature of the election, but that it was not up to us to determine what the outcome was. As soon as violence broke out -- in fact, in anticipation of potential violence -- we were very clear in saying that violence was unacceptable, that that was not how governments operate with respect to their people.So we've been entirely consistent, Major, in terms of how we've approached this. My role has been to say the United States is not going to be a foil for the Iranian government to try to blame what's happening on the streets of Tehran on the CIA or on the White House; that this is an issue that is led by and given voice to the frustrations of the Iranian people. And so we've been very consistent the first day, and we're going to continue to be consistent in saying this is not an issue about the United States; this is about an issue of the Iranian people.What we've also been consistent about is saying that there are some universal principles, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, making sure that governments are not using coercion and violence and repression in terms of how they interact with peaceful demonstrators. And we have been speaking out very clearly about that fact.Q: Are Iranian diplomats still welcome at the embassy on the Fourth of July, sir?President Obama: Well, I think as you're aware, Major, we don't have formal diplomatic relations with -- we don't have formal diplomatic relations with Iran. I think that we have said that if Iran chooses a path that abides by international norms and principles, then we are interested in healing some of the wounds of 30 years, in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations. But that is a choice that the Iranians are going to have to make.Q: But the offer still stands?President Obama: That's a choice the Iranians are going to have to make.David Jackson.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Two of the key players in the insurance industry, America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross-Blue Shield, sent a letter to the Senate this morning saying that a government health insurance plan would \"dismantle\" private insurers. Why are they wrong? And secondly, this public plan, is this non-negotiable? Would you sign a health care bill without it?President Obama: Well, let's talk first of all about health care reform more broadly.I think in this debate there's been some notion that if we just stand pat we're okay. And that's just not true. You know, there are polls out that show that 70 or 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with the health insurance that they currently have. The only problem is that premiums have been doubling every nine years, going up three times faster than wages. The U.S. government is not going to be able to afford Medicare and Medicaid on its current trajectory. Businesses are having to make very tough decisions about whether we drop coverage or we further restrict coverage.So the notion that somehow we can just keep on doing what we're doing and that's okay, that's just not true. We have a longstanding critical problem in our health care system that is pulling down our economy, it's burdening families, it's burdening businesses, and it is the primary driver of our federal deficits. All right?So if we start from the premise that the status Q: uo is unacceptable, then that means we're going to have to bring about some serious changes. What I've said is, our top priority has to be to control costs. And that means not just tinkering around the edges. It doesn't mean just lopping off reimbursements for doctors in any given year because we're trying to fix our budget. It means that we look at the kinds of incentives that exist, what our delivery system is like, why it is that some communities are spending 30 percent less than other communities but getting better health care outcomes, and figuring out how can we make sure that everybody is benefiting from lower costs and better quality by improving practices. It means health IT. It means prevention.So all these things are the starting point, I think, for reform. And I've said very clearly: If any bill arrives from Congress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I can support. It's going to have to control costs. It's going to have to be paid for. So there's been a lot of talk about, well, a trillion-dollar price tag. What I've said is, if we're going to spend that much money, then it's going to be largely funded through reallocating dollars that are already in the health care system but aren't being spent well. If we're spending $177 billion over 10 years to subsidize insurance companies under Medicare Advantage, when there's no showing that people are healthier using that program than the regular Medicare program, well, that's not a good deal for taxpayers. And we're going to take that money and we're going to use it to provide better care at a cheaper cost to the American people. So that's point number one.Number two, while we are in the process of dealing with the cost issue, I think it's also wise policy and the right thing to do to start providing coverage for people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured, are paying a lot of money for high deductibles. I get letters -- two, three letters a day -- that I read of families who don't have health insurance, are going bankrupt, are on the brink of losing their insurance; have deductibles that are so high that even with insurance they end up with $50,000, $100,000 worth of debt; are at risk of losing their homes.And that has to be part of reform, making sure that even if you've got health insurance now, you are not worried that when you lose your job or your employer decides to change policies that somehow you're going to be out of luck. I think about the woman who was in Wisconsin that I was with, who introduced me up in Green Bay -- 36 years old, double mastectomy; breast cancer has now moved to her bones and she's got two little kids, a husband with a job. They had health insurance, but they're still $50,000 in debt, and she's thinking, my main legacy, if I don't survive this thing, is going to be leaving $100,000 worth of debt. So those are the things that I'm prioritizing.Now, the public plan I think is a important tool to discipline insurance companies. What we've said is, under our proposal, let's have a system the same way that federal employees do, same way that members of Congress do, where -- we call it an \"exchange,\" or you can call it a \"marketplace\" -- where essentially you've got a whole bunch of different plans. If you like your plan and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing. You keep your plan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you good health insurance, terrific, we're not going to mess with it.But if you're a small business person, if the insurance that's being offered is something you can't afford, if you want to shop for a better price, then you can go to this exchange, this marketplace, and you can look: Okay, this is how much this plan costs, this is how much that plan costs, this is what the coverage is like, this is what fits for my family. As one of those options, for us to be able to say, here's a public option that's not profit-driven, that can keep down administrative costs and that provides you good, quality care for a reasonable price -- as one of the options for you to choose, I think that makes sense.Q: Won't that drive private insurers out of business?President Obama: Why would it drive private insurers out of business? If private insurers say that the marketplace provides the best quality health care, if they tell us that they're offering a good deal, then why is it that the government -- which they say can't run anything -- suddenly is going to drive them out of business? That's not logical.Now, I think that there's going to be some healthy debates in Congress about the shape that this takes. I think there can be some legitimate concerns on the part of private insurers that if any public plan is simply being subsidized by taxpayers endlessly, that over time they can't compete with the government just printing money.So there are going to be some I think legitimate debates to be had about how this private plan takes shape. But just conceptually, the notion that all these insurance companies who say they're giving consumers the best possible deal, that they can't compete against a public plan as one option, with consumers making the decision what's the best deal. That defies logic, which is why I think you've seen in the polling data overwhelming support for a public plan. All right?Q: Is that non-negotiable?President Obama: Chip.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Following up on Major's question, some republicans on Capitol Hill -- John McCain and Lindsey Graham, for example -- have said that up to this point, your response on Iran has been timid and weak. Today, it sounded a lot stronger. It sounded like the kind of speech John McCain has been urging you to give, saying that those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history, referring to an iron fist in Iran -- \"deplore,\" \"appalled,\" \"outraged.\" Were you influenced at all by John McCain and Lindsey Graham accusing you of being timid and weak?President Obama: What do you think? Look, the -- I think John McCain has genuine passion about many of these international issues, and I think that all of us share a belief that we want justice to prevail. But only I'm the President of the United States, and I've got responsibilities in making certain that we are continually advancing our national security interests and that we are not used as a tool to be exploited by other countries.I mean, you guys must have seen the reports. They've got some of the comments that I've made being mistranslated in Iran, suggesting that I'm telling rioters to go out and riot some more. There are reports suggesting that the CIA is behind all this -- all of which are patently false. But it gives you a sense of the narrative that the Iranian government would love to play into. So the -- members of Congress, they've got their constitutional duties, and I'm sure they will carry them out in the way that they think is appropriate. I'm President of the United States, and I'll carry out my duties as I think are appropriate. All right?Q: By speaking so strongly today, aren't you giving the leadership in Iran the fodder to make those arguments that it is about the United States?President Obama: Look, I mean, I think that -- we can parse this as much as we want. I think if you look at the statements that I've made, they've been very consistent. I just made a statement on Saturday in which we said we deplore the violence. And so I think that in the hothouse of Washington, there may be all kinds of stuff going back and forth in terms of Republican critics versus the administration. That's not what is relevant to the Iranian people. What's relevant to them right now is, are they going to have their voices heard?And, frankly, a lot of them aren't paying a lot of attention to what's being said on Capitol Hill, and probably aren't spending a lot of time thinking about what's being said here. They're trying to figure out how can they make sure justice is served in Iran.Q: So there's no news in your statement today?President Obama: Chuck Todd.Q: Mr. President, I want to follow up on Iran. You have avoided twice spelling out consequences. You've hinted that there would be, from the international community, if they continue to violate -- you said violate these norms. You seem to hint that there are human rights violations taking place./President Obama: I'm not hinting. I think that when a young woman gets shot on the street when she gets out of her car, that's a problem.Q: Then why won't you spell out the consequences that the Iranian --President Obama: Because I think, Chuck, that we don't know yet how this thing is going to play out. I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news cycle. I'm not.Q: But shouldn't -- I mean, shouldn't the world and Iran --President Obama: Chuck, I answered --Q: -- but shouldn't the Iranian regime know that there are consequences?President Obama: I answered the question, Chuck, which is that we don't yet know how this is going to play out.Jake Tapper.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Before I ask my question, I'm wondering if you could actually answer David's. Is the public plan non-negotiable?President Obama: That's your question.Q: Well, you didn't answer --President Obama: You think you're going to -- are you the ombudsman for the White House press corps? What's your -- is that your question?Q: Then I have a two-part question. Is the public plan non-negotiable? And while I appreciate your Spock-like language about the logic of the health care plan, the public plan, it does seem logical to a lot of people that if the government is offering a cheaper health care plan, then lots of employers will want to have their employees covered by that cheaper plan, which will not have to be for profit, unlike private plans, and may possibly benefit from some government subsidies, who knows. And then their employees would be signed up for this public plan, which would violate what you're promising the American people, that they will not have to change health care plans if they like the plan they have.President Obama: I got you. You're pitching, I'm catching. I got the question. First of all, was the reference to Spock -- is that a crack on my ears? All right, I just want to make sure. No?Q: I would never make fun of your ears, sir.President Obama: In answer to David's question, which you co-opted, we are still early in this process, so we have not drawn lines in the sand other than that reform has to control costs and that it has to provide relief to people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured. Those are the broad parameters that we've discussed.There are a whole host of other issues where ultimately I may have a strong opinion, and I will express those to members of Congress as this is shaping up. It's too early to say that. Right now I will say that our position is that a public plan makes sense.Now, let me go to the broader question you made about the public plan. As I said before, I think that there is a legitimate concern if the public plan was simply eating off the taxpayer trough, that it would be hard for private insurers to complete. If, on the other hand, the public plan is structured in such a way where they've got to collect premiums and they've got to provide good services, then if what the insurance companies are saying is true, that they're doing their best to serve their customers, that they're in the business of keeping people well and giving them security when they get sick, they should be able to compete.Now, if it turns out that the public plan, for example, is able to reduce administrative costs significantly, then you know what? I'd like insurance companies to take note and say, hey, if the public plan can do that, why can't we? And that's good for everybody in the system. And I don't think there should be any objection to that.Now, by the way, I should point out that part of the reform that we've suggested is that if you want to be a private insurer as part of the exchange, as part of this marketplace, this menu of options that people can choose from, we're going to have some different rules for all insurance companies -- one of them being that you can't preclude people from getting health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, you can't cherry pick and just take the healthiest people.So there are going to be some ground rules that are going to apply to all insurance companies, because I think the American people understand that, too often, insurance companies have been spending more time thinking about how to take premiums and then avoid providing people coverage than they have been thinking about how can we make sure that insurance is there, health care is there when families need it.But I'm confident that if -- I take those advocates of the free market to heart when they say that the free market is innovative and is going to compete on service and is going to compete on their ability to deliver good care to families. And if that's the case then this just becomes one more option. If it's not the case then I think that that's something that the American people should know.Q: I'm sorry, but what about keeping your promise to the American people that they won't have to change plans even if employers --President Obama: Well, no, no, I mean -- when I say if you have your plan and you like it and your doctor has a plan, or you have a doctor and you like your doctor that you don't have to change plans, what I'm saying is the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform.Now, are there going to be employers right now -- assuming we don't do anything -- let's say that we take the advice of some folks who are out there and say, oh, this is not the time to do health care, we can't afford it, it's too complicated, let's take our time, et cetera. So let's assume that nothing happened. I can guarantee you that there's a possibility for a whole lot of Americans out there that they're not going to end up having the same health care they have, because what's going to happen is, as costs keep on going up, employers are going to start making decisions: We've got to raise premiums on our employees; in some cases, we can't provide health insurance at all.And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's exactly why health reform is so important.Margaret, from McClatchy. Where's Margaret? There you are.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. As a former smoker, I understand the frustration and the fear that comes with quitting. But with the new law that you signed yesterday regulating the tobacco industry, I'd like to ask you a few questions. How many cigarettes a day --President Obama: A few questions?Q: How many cigarettes a day do you now smoke? Do you smoke alone or in the presence of other people? And do you believe the new law would help you to Q: uit? If so, why?President Obama: Well, first of all, the new law that was put in place is not about me, it's about the next generation of kids coming up. So I think it's fair, Margaret, to just say that you just think it's neat to ask me about my smoking, as opposed to it being relevant to my new law. But that's fine, I understand. It's an interesting human -- it's an interesting human interest story.But I've said before that, as a former smoker, I constantly struggle with it. Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in front of my family, and I would say that I am 95 percent cured, but there are times where -- there are times where I mess up. And, I mean, I've said this before. I get this question about once every month or so, and I don't know what to tell you, other than the fact that, like folks who go to AA, once you've gone down this path, then it's something you continually struggle with, which is precisely why the legislation we signed was so important, because what we don't want is kids going down that path in the first place. Okay?Macarena Vidal?Q: Mr. President, you're meeting today with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. You're meeting next week with Alvaro Uribe from Colombia. Two months ago in Trinidad at the Summit of the Americas, you said that -- you called on Latin American countries to help you with deeds, not words, particularly towards less democratic countries. Have you noticed any particular progress in these two months, and can you give us examples?President Obama: Well, first of all, I'm very much looking forward to seeing President Bachelet. I think she's one of the finest leaders in Latin America, a very capable person. If you look at how Chile has handled the recession, they've handled it very well in part because the surpluses that they got when copper prices were high they set aside. And so they had the resources to deal with the downturn. It's a good lesson for the United States. When we had surpluses, they got dissipated.We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin America generally. One of the things that I'll be talking about with President Bachelet is the coordination and cooperation between the United State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcement when we do our press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energy partnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on cancer research. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. And, by the way, Chile has actually entered into some very interesting partnerships not just with the federal government, but also with state governments like California.So I think the relationship that we have with Chile -- which, by the way, does not fall in line with U.S. foreign policy on every single issue -- but it's a respectful policy. Chile is an important partner. I think that's the model that we want: partnership. The United States doesn't dictate how Chile should view its own interests, but in fact we've achieved great cooperation. And I will be looking at President Bachelet giving us further advice in terms of how we can take the kind of relationship we have with Chile and expand that to our relationships throughout Latin America.Q: But my question is not only about that -- Chile, but about Latin American countries giving you a hand on -- against less democratic countries.President Obama: Well, the point is, is that I think Chile is leading by example. So I'm using Chile as an example. But the same is true in Brazil, for example. I mean, President Lula came in, and he's got a very different political orientation than most Americans do. He came up through the trade union movement. He was perceived as a strong leftist. It turns out that he was a very practical person, who although maintains relationships across the political spectrum in Latin America, has instituted all sorts of smart market reforms that have made Brazil prosper.And so if you take a Bachelet or a Lula, and the United States has a good working relationship with them, then I think that points the way for other countries that may be where the democratic tradition is not as deeply embedded as we'd like it to be. And we can make common cause in showing those countries that, in fact, democracy, respect for property rights, respects for market-based economies, rule of law -- that all those things can in fact lead to greater prosperity, that that's not just a U.S. agenda, but that's a smart way to increase the prosperity of your own people.Okay, Hans Nichols. Hans.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. If I can just return to the economy more generally. When you were selling the economic stimulus package, you talked and your advisors and economists talked about keeping unemployment below 8 percent. Last week you acknowledged that unemployment is likely to reach double digits, being 10 percent. Do you think you need a second stimulus package?President Obama: Well, not yet, because I think it's important to see how the economy evolves and how effective the first stimulus is. I think it's fair to say that -- keep in mind the stimulus package was the first thing we did, and we did it a couple of weeks after inauguration. At that point nobody understood what the depths of this recession were going to look like. If you recall, it was only significantly later that we suddenly get a report that the economy had tanked.And so it's not surprising then that we missed the mark in terms of our estimates of where unemployment would go. I think it's pretty clear now that unemployment will end up going over 10 percent, if you just look at the pattern, because of the fact that even after employers and businesses start investing again and start hiring again, typically it takes a while for that employment number to catch up with economic recovery. And we're still not at actual recovery yet.So I anticipate that this is going to be a difficult -- difficult year, a difficult period.Q: What's the high water mark, then, for unemployment? Eleven percent?President Obama: Well, I'm not suggesting that I have a crystal ball. Since you just threw back at us our last prognosis, let's not -- let's not engage in another one.Q: Does that mean you won't be making predictions ever?President Obama: But what I am saying is that -- here are some things I know for certain. In the absence of the stimulus, I think our recession would be much worse. It would have declined -- without the Recovery Act -- we know for a fact that states, for example, would have laid off a lot more teachers, a lot more police officers, a lot more firefighters, every single one of those individuals whose jobs were saved. As a consequence, they are still making their mortgage payments, they are still shopping. So we know that the Recovery Act has had an impact.Now, what we also know is this was the worst recession since the Great Depression, and people are going through a very tough time right now. And I don't expect them to be satisfied. I mean, one thing that -- as I sometimes glance at the various news outlets represented here, I know that they're sometimes reporting of, oh, the administration is worried about this, or their poll numbers are going down there -- look, the American people have a right to feel like this is a tough time right now. What's incredible to me is how resilient the American people have been and how they are still more optimistic than the facts alone would justify, because this is a tough, tough period.And I don't feel satisfied with the progress that we've made. We've got to get our Recovery Act money out faster. We've got to make sure that the programs that we've put in place are working the way they're supposed to. I think, for example, our mortgage program has actually helped to modify mortgages for a lot of people, but it hasn't been keeping pace with all the foreclosures that are taking place. I get letters every day from people who say, you know, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the bank is still not letting me modify my mortgage and I'm about to lose my home. And then I've got to call my staff and team and find out why isn't it working for these folks, and can we adjust it, can we tweak it, can we make it more aggressive?This is a very, very difficult process. And what I've got to do is to make sure that we're focused both on the short term, how can we provide families immediate relief and jumpstart the economy as quickly as possible; and I've got to keep my eye on the long term, and the long term is making sure that by reforming our health care system, by passing serious energy legislation that makes us a clean energy economy, by revamping our education system, by finally getting the financial regulatory reforms in place that are necessary for the 21st century -- by doing all those things, we've got a foundation for long-term economic growth, and we don't end up having to juice up the economy artificially through the kinds of bubble strategies that helped to get us in the situation that we're in today.Okay. I've got time for two more questions. April. Where's April?Q: Right here.President Obama: There you are. How are you?Q: I'm fine. Back on the economy, Mr. President, people are criticizing this road to recovery plan. Specifically, there are reports in The Washington Post that say that the African America unemployment rate will go to 20 percent by the end of this year. And then you had your Chairman of Economic Advisers say the target intervention may come next year if nothing changes. Why not target intervention now to stop the bloodletting in the black unemployment rate?President Obama: Look, first of all, we know that the African American unemployment rate, the Latino unemployment rate, are consistently higher than the national average. And so, if the economy as a whole is doing poorly, then you know that the African American community is going to be doing poorly, and they're going to be hit even harder. And the best thing that I can do for the African American community or the Latino community or the Asian community, whatever community, is to get the economy as a whole moving. If I don't -- hold on one second, let me answer the question -- if I don't do that, then I'm not going to be able to help anybody. So that's priority number one.It is true that in certain inner-city communities, the unemployment rate is -- was already sky high even before this recession. The ladders available for people to enter into the job market are even worse. And so we are interested in looking at proven programs that help people on a pathway to jobs.There was a reason why right before Father's Day I went to a program here locally in Washington called Year Up, which has a proven track record of taking young, mostly minority people, some of whom have graduated from high school, some maybe who've just gotten their GED, and trained them on computers and provide them other technical skills, but also train them on how to carry themselves in an office, how to write an e-mail -- some of the social skills that will allow them to be more employable. They've got a terrific placement rate after this one-year program. If there are ways that we can potentially duplicate some of those programs, then we're going to do so.So part of what we want to do is to find tools that will give people more opportunity, but the most important thing I can do is to lift the economy overall. And that's what my strategy is focused on.All right. Last Question. Suzanne.Q: Thank you. Back to Iran, putting a human face on this. Over the weekend, we saw a shocking video of this woman, Neda, who had been shot in the chest and bled to death. Have you seen this video?President Obama: I have.Q: What's your reaction?President Obama: It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. And I think that anybody who sees it knows that there's something fundamentally unjust about that.Q: We also have people on the ground who have been saying that the streets are quieter now and that is because they feel that they're paralyzed by fear -- fear of people gone missing, fear of violence, that perhaps this is a movement that's gone underground or perhaps is dying. Do you have any concern over that?President Obama: Yes. I have concern about how peaceful demonstrators and people who want their votes counted may be stifled from expressing those concerns. I think, as I said before, there are certain international norms of freedom of speech, freedom of expression --Q: Then why won't you allow the photos --President Obama: Hold on a second, Helen. That's a different question. And I think it's important for us to make sure that we let the Iranian people know that we are watching what's happening, that they are not alone in this process. Ultimately, though, what's going to be most important is what happens in Iran. And we've all been struck by the courage of people. And I mentioned this I think in a statement that I made a couple of days ago. Some of you who had been covering my campaigns know this is one of my favorite expressions, was Dr. King's expression that \"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" We have to believe that ultimately justice will prevail.All right.

It is a great honor for me to join you at the New Economic School. Michelle and I are so pleased to be in Moscow. And as somebody who was born in Hawaii, I'm glad to be here in July instead of January.</p><p>I know that NES is a young school, but I speak to you today with deep respect for Russia's timeless heritage. Russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, and recognize eternal truths. Russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms of beauty. Russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go to space.</p><p>These are contributions that are not contained by Russia's borders, as vast as those borders are. Indeed, Russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share. That includes my own country, which has been blessed with Russian immigrants for decades; we've been enriched by Russian culture, and enhanced by Russian cooperation. And as a resident of Washington, D.C., I continue to benefit from the contributions of Russians -- specifically, from Alexander Ovechkin. We're very pleased to have him in Washington, D.C.</p><p></p><p>Here at NES, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no less fundamental to the future of humanity. As Pushkin said, \"Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much as poetry.\" And today, I want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate. You're poised to be leaders in academia and industry; in finance and government. But before you move forward, it's worth reflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives.</p><p>Like President Medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of the Cold War, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, and we reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe. But you are the last generation born when the world was divided. At that time, the American and Soviet armies were still massed in Europe, trained and ready to fight. The ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place. Competition in everything from astrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game. If one person won, then the other person had to lose.</p><p>And then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be. Now, make no mistake: This change did not come from any one nation. The Cold War reached a conclusion because of the actions of many nations over many years, and because the people of Russia and Eastern Europe stood up and decided that its end would be peaceful.</p><p>With the end of the Cold War, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for prosperity; for new arrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals. Like all periods of great change, it was a time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities. But, of course, things don't always work out exactly as planned. Back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one NES student summed up the difficulty of change when he told a reporter, and I quote him: \"The real world is not so rational as on paper.\" The real world is not so rational as on paper.</p><p>Over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world. Great wealth has been created, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty. Poverty exists here, it exists in the United States, and it exists all around the world. More people have gone to the ballot box, but too many governments still fail to protect the rights of their people. Ideological struggles have diminished, but they've been replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion. A human being with a computer can hold the same amount of information stored in the Russian State Library, but that technology can also be used to do great harm.</p><p>In a new Russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the Soviet Union brought both opportunity and hardship. A few prospered, but many more did not. There were tough times. But the Russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earned progress through a growing economy and greater confidence. And despite painful times, many in Eastern Europe and Russia are much better off today than 20 years ago.</p><p>We see that progress here at NES -- a school founded with Western support that is now distinctly Russian; a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is Russian or American or European, but whether it works. Above all, we see that progress in all of you -- young people with a young century to shape as you see fit.\u00a0Your lifetime coincides with this era of transition. But think about the fundamental questions asked when this school was founded. What kind of future is Russia going to have? What kind of future are Russia and America going to have together?\u00a0 What world order will replace the Cold War? Those questions still don't have clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your generation in Russia, in America, and around the world. You get to decide. And while I cannot answer those questions for you, I can speak plainly about the future that America is seeking.</p><p>To begin with, let me be clear: America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia. This belief is rooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyond competition. Despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century. Recently, I noted this when I was in Normandy -- for just as men from Boston and Birmingham risked all that they had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, Soviet soldiers from places like Kazan and Kiev endured unimaginable hardships to repeal -- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east. As President John Kennedy said, \"No nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union in the Second World War.\"</p><p>So as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrant Russia. Think of the issues that will define your lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; access to markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an international system that protects sovereignty and human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity. These challenges demand global partnership, and that partnership will be stronger if Russia occupies its rightful place as a great power.</p><p>Yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking; a conception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future. There is the 20th century view that the United States and Russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong Russia or a strong America can only assert themselves in opposition to one another. And there is a 19th century view that we are destined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance one another.</p><p>These assumptions are wrong. In 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizing other countries. The days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.As I said in Cairo, given our independence, any world order that -- given our interdependence, any world order that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game -- progress must be shared.</p><p>That's why I have called for a \"reset\" in relations between the United States and Russia. This must be more than a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House -- though that is important and I've had excellent discussions with both your President and your Prime Minister. It must be a sustained effort among the American and Russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation that can pave the way to progress.</p><p>This will not be easy. It's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard to change habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades. But I believe that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, Americans and Russians share common interests that form a basis for cooperation.\u00a0 It is not for me to define Russia's national interests, but I can tell you about America's national interests, and I believe that you will see that we share common ground.</p><p>First, America has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use.</p><p>In the last century, generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and the understanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction. In 2009, our inheritance is different. You and I don't have to ask whether American and Russian leaders will respect a balance of terror -- we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries. But we do have to ask this question: We have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in New York and in Moscow will show that same restraint. We have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations will protect their arsenals and refrain from using them.</p><p>This is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century. The notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an illusion. In the short period since the end of the Cold War, we've already seen India, Pakistan, and North Korea conduct nuclear tests. Without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believe that the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons?</p><p>That's why America is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world without nuclear weapons. That is consistent with our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That is our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers. And while I know this goal won't be met soon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use of nuclear weapons.</p><p>We're already taking important steps to build this foundation. Yesterday, President Medvedev and I made progress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems. We renewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nations that live up to their responsibilities under the NPT. And we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclear security, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.</p><p>As we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs. Whether America or Russia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East. That's why we should be united in opposing North Korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon. And I'm pleased that President Medvedev and I agreed upon a joint threat assessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from Iran and North Korea.</p><p>This is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations. If we fail to stand together, then the NPT and the Security Council will lose credibility, and international law will give way to the law of the jungle. And that benefits no one. As I said in Prague, rules must be binding, violations must be punished, and words must mean something.</p><p>The successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement. I know Russia opposes the planned configuration for missile defense in Europe. And my administration is reviewing these plans to enhance the security of America, Europe and the world. And I've made it clear that this system is directed at preventing a potential attack from Iran. It has nothing to do with Russia. In fact, I want to work together with Russia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer. But if the threat from Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in Europe will be eliminated, and that is in our mutual interests.</p><p>Now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where America has a critical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists.</p><p>For years, al Qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlessly murdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths. Indeed, above all, they have murdered Muslims. And these extremists have killed in Amman and Bali; Islamabad and Kabul; and they have the blood of Americans and Russians on their hands. They're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefit from safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p>And that's why America has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations. Instead, we want to work with international partners, including Russia, to help Afghans and Pakistanis advance their own security and prosperity. And that's why I'm pleased that Russia has agreed to allow the United States to supply our coalition forces through your territory. Neither America nor Russia has an interest in an Afghanistan or Pakistan governed by the Taliban. It's time to work together on behalf of a different future -- a future in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present; a future in which all of us contribute to the security of Central Asia.</p><p>Now, beyond Afghanistan, America is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists. We are helping the Iraqi people build a better future, and leaving Iraq to the Iraqis. We're pursuing the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security. We're partnering with Muslim communities around the world to advance education, health, and economic development. In each of these endeavors, I believe that the Russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success -- and we need to partner together.</p><p>Now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that I will discuss is America's interest in global prosperity. And since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, I know this is of great interest to you.</p><p>We meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation. I believe that the free market is the greatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known. But wherever the market is allowed to run rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption -- then all are endangered, whether we live on the Mississippi or on the Volga.</p><p>In America, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system of regulation. But just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one can serve as the sole engine of global growth. You see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed. And while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity.\u00a0Think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago. A young woman with an Internet connection in Bangalore, India can compete with anybody anywhere in the world. An entrepreneur with a start-up company in Beijing can take his business global. An NES professor in Moscow can collaborate with colleagues at Harvard or Stanford. That's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in India, that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in China, that pushes our businesses to innovate; when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched.</p><p>There is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between Americans and Russians. We can pursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world. We can boost investment that creates jobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, like oil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change. All of that, Americans and Russians can do together.</p><p>Now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation, because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you. It's people; it's young people especially. And the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed. That success depends upon economies that function within the rule of law. As President Medvedev has rightly said, a mature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development. People everywhere should have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe. Whether they are in America or Russia or Africa or Latin America, that's not a American idea or a Russian idea -- that's how people and countries will succeed in the 21st century.</p><p>And this brings me to the fourth issue that I will discuss -- America's interest in democratic governments that protect the rights of their people.</p><p></p><p>By no means is America perfect. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us to correct our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time. Freedom of speech and assembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time when they were denied. The rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut down political machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power. Independent media have exposed corruption at all levels of business and government. Competitive elections allow us to change course and hold our leaders accountable. If our democracy did not advance those rights, then I, as a person of African ancestry, wouldn't be able to address you as an American citizen, much less a President. Because at the time of our founding, I had no rights -- people who looked like me. But it is because of that process that I can now stand before you as President of the United States.</p><p>So around the world, America supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work. The arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governments which serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments that promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America's most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia -- nations that today live with great security and prosperity.</p><p>Now let me be clear: America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on any other country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. And we haven't always done what we should have on that front. Even as we meet here today, America supports now the restoration of the democratically-elected President of Honduras, even though he has strongly opposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with or not.</p><p>And that leads me to the final area that I will discuss, which is America's interest in an international system that advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations.</p><p>State sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order. Just as all states should have the right to choose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies. That is true for Russia, just as it is true for the United States. Any system that cedes those rights will lead to anarchy. That's why we must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes nations like Georgia and Ukraine. America will never impose a security arrangement on another country. For any country to become a member of an organization like NATO, for example, a majority of its people must choose to; they must undertake reforms; they must be able to contribute to the Alliance's mission. And let me be clear: NATO should be seeking collaboration with Russia, not confrontation.</p><p>And more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples. As President of the United States, I will work tirelessly to protect America's security and to advance our interests. But no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world. That is something that America now understands, just as Russia understands. That's why America seeks an international system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interests diverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, with clear rights and responsibilities for all.</p><p>There was a time when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin could shape the world in one meeting. Those days are over. The world is more complex today. Billions of people have found their voice, and seek their own measure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet. Over the past two decades, we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy. We've seen old hatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away; we've seen the human destiny in the hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies. Now, we must see that the period of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, and people realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children. That is America's interest, and I believe that it is Russia's interest as well.</p><p>I know that this future can seem distant. Change is hard. In the words of that NES student back in 1993, the real world is not so rational as on paper. But think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time. One hundred years ago, a czar ruled Russia, and Europe was a place of empire.\u00a0 When I was born, segregation was still the law of the land in parts of America, and my father's Kenya was still a colony. When you were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the Internet was only known to a privileged few.</p><p>You get to decide what comes next. You get to choose where change will take us, because the future does not belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongs to young people with an education and the imagination to create. That is the source of power in this century. And given all that has happened in your two decades on Earth, just imagine what you can create in the years to come.</p><p>Every country charts its own course. Russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through a canyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes. As you move this story forward, look to the future that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions; look to the future that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common. Together, we can build a world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress. And it is all in your hands. Good luck to all of you.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [37.6260149, 55.753611]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties":

honor for me to be in Accra and to speak to the representatives of the people of Ghana.\u00a0\u00a0I am deeply grateful for the welcome that I've received, as are Michelle and Malia and Sasha Obama.\u00a0Ghana's history is rich, the ties between our two countries are strong, and I am proud that this is my first visit to sub-Saharan Africa as President of the United States of America.I want to thank Madam Speaker and all the members of the House of Representatives for hosting us today.\u00a0I want to thank </p><p>President Mills for his outstanding leadership.\u00a0To the former Presidents -- </p><p>Jerry Rawlings, former </p><p>President Kufuor -- </p><p>Vice President, </p><p>Chief Justice -- thanks to all of you for your extraordinary hospitality and the wonderful institutions that you've built here in Ghana.I'm speaking to you at the end of a long trip.\u00a0I began in Russia for a summit between two great powers.\u00a0I traveled to Italy for a meeting of the world's leading economies.\u00a0And I've come here to Ghana for a simple reason:\u00a0The 21st century will be shaped by what happens not just in Rome or Moscow or Washington, but by what happens in Accra, as well.This is the simple truth of a time when the boundaries between people are overwhelmed by our connections.\u00a0Your prosperity can expand America's prosperity.\u00a0Your health and security can contribute to the world's health and security.\u00a0And the strength of your democracy can help advance human rights for people everywhere.So I do not see the countries and peoples of Africa as a world apart; I see Africa as a fundamental part of our interconnected world -- as partners with America on behalf of the future we want for all of our children.\u00a0That partnership must be grounded in mutual responsibility and mutual respect.\u00a0And that is what I want to speak with you about today.We must start from the simple premise that Africa's future is up to Africans.I say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world.\u00a0After all, I have the blood of Africa within me, and my family's -- my family's own story encompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger African story.Some you know my grandfather was a cook for the British in Kenya, and though he was a respected elder in his village, his employers called him \"boy\" for much of his life.\u00a0He was on the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles, but he was still imprisoned briefly during repressive times.\u00a0In his life, colonialism wasn't simply the creation of unnatural borders or unfair terms of trade -- it was something experienced personally, day after day, year after year.My father grew up herding goats in a tiny village, an impossible distance away from the American universities where he would come to get an education.\u00a0He came of age at a moment of extraordinary promise for Africa.\u00a0The struggles of his own father's generation were giving birth to new nations, beginning right here in Ghana.\u00a0\u00a0Africans were educating and asserting themselves in new ways, and history was on the move.But despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in many parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled.\u00a0Countries like Kenya had a per capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born.\u00a0They have badly been outpaced.\u00a0Disease and conflict have ravaged parts of the African continent.In many places, the hope of my father's generation gave way to cynicism, even despair.\u00a0Now, it's easy to point fingers and to pin the blame of these problems on others.\u00a0Yes, a colonial map that made little sense helped to breed conflict.\u00a0The West has often approached Africa as a patron or a source of resources rather than a partner.\u00a0But the West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade, or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants.\u00a0In my father's life, it was partly tribalism and patronage and nepotism in an independent Kenya that for a long stretch derailed his career, and we know that this kind of corruption is still a daily fact of life for far too many.Now, we know that's also not the whole story.\u00a0Here in Ghana, you show us a face of Africa that is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or a need for charity.\u00a0The people of Ghana have worked hard to put democracy on a firmer footing, with repeated peaceful transfers of power even in the wake of closely contested elections.\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, can I say that for that the minority deserves as much credit as the majority.\u00a0\u00a0And with improved governance and an emerging civil society, Ghana's economy has shown impressive rates of growth.This progress may lack the drama of 20th century liberation struggles, but make no mistake:\u00a0It will ultimately be more significant.\u00a0For just as it is important to emerge from the control of other nations, it is even more important to build one's own nation.So I believe that this moment is just as promising for Ghana and for Africa as the moment when my father came of age and new nations were being born.\u00a0This is a new moment of great promise.\u00a0Only this time, we've learned that it will not be giants like </p><p>Nkrumah and</p><p>Kenyatta who will determine Africa's future.\u00a0Instead, it will be you -- the men and women in Ghana's parliament -- the people you represent.\u00a0It will be the young people brimming with talent and energy and hope who can claim the future that so many in previous generations never realized.Now, to realize that promise, we must first recognize the fundamental truth that you have given life to in Ghana:\u00a0Development depends on good governance.\u00a0 \u00a0That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places, for far too long.\u00a0That's the change that can unlock Africa's potential.\u00a0And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans.As for America and the West, our commitment must be measured by more than just the dollars we spend.\u00a0I've pledged substantial increases in our foreign assistance, which is in Africa's interests and America's interests.\u00a0But the true sign of success is not whether we are a source of perpetual aid that helps people scrape by -- it's whether we are partners in building the capacity for transformational change.This mutual responsibility must be the foundation of our partnership.\u00a0And today, I'll focus on four areas that are critical to the future of Africa and the entire developing world:\u00a0democracy, opportunity, health, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.First, we must support strong and sustainable democratic governments.As I -- As I said in Cairo, each nation gives life to democracy in its own way, and in line with its own traditions.\u00a0But history offers a clear verdict:\u00a0Governments that respect the will of their own people, that govern by consent and not coercion, are more -- more prosperous, they are more stable, and more successful than governments that do not.This is about more than just holding elections.\u00a0It's also about what happens between elections.\u00a0\u00a0Repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that have elections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to poverty.\u00a0No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves -- or -- or if police -- if police can be bought off by drug traffickers.\u00a0\u00a0No business -- No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top -- or the head of the Port Authority is corrupt.\u00a0No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery.\u00a0\u00a0That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinkle an election in there.\u00a0And now is the time for that style of governance to end.In the 21st century, capable, reliable, and transparent institutions are the key to success -- strong parliaments; honest police forces; independent judges; an\u00a0independent press; a vibrant private sector; a civil society.\u00a0\u00a0Those are the things that give life to democracy, because that is what matters in people's everyday lives.Now, time and again, Ghanaians have chosen constitutional rule over autocracy, and shown a democratic spirit that allows the energy of your people to break through.\u00a0\u00a0We see that in leaders who accept defeat graciously -- the fact that President Mills' opponents were standing beside him last night to greet me when I came off the plane spoke volumes about Ghana; victors who resist calls to wield power against the opposition in unfair ways.\u00a0We see that spirit in courageous journalists like </p><p>Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to </p><p>report the truth.\u00a0We see it in police like</p><p>Patience Quaye, who helped prosecute the first human trafficker in Ghana.\u00a0\u00a0We see it in the young people who are speaking up against patronage, and participating in the political process.Across Africa, we've seen countless examples of people taking control of their destiny, and making change from the bottom up.\u00a0We saw it in Kenya, where civil society and business came together to help stop post-election violence. We saw it in South Africa, where over three-quarters of the country voted in the recent election -- the fourth since the end of Apartheid.\u00a0We saw it in Zimbabwe, where the Election Support Network braved brutal repression to stand up for the principle that a person's vote is their sacred right.Now, make no mistake:\u00a0History is on the side of these brave Africans, not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power.\u00a0\u00a0Africa -- Africa doesn't need strongmen; it needs strong institutions.Now, America will not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation.\u00a0The essential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny. But what America will do is increase assistance for responsible individuals and responsible institutions, with a focus on supporting good governance -- on parliaments, which check abuses of power and ensure that opposition voices are heard; on the rule of law, which ensures the equal administration of justice; on civic participation, so that young people get involved; and on concrete solutions to corruption like forensic accounting and automating services -- strengthening hotlines, protecting whistle-blowers to advance transparency and accountability.And we provide this support.\u00a0I have directed my Administration to give greater attention to corruption in our human rights reports.\u00a0People everywhere should have the right to start a business or get an education without paying a bribe.\u00a0\u00a0We have a responsibility to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America will do.Now, this leads directly to our second area of partnership:\u00a0supporting development that provides opportunity for more people.With better governance, I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base of prosperity.\u00a0Witness the extraordinary success of Africans in my country, America.\u00a0They're doing very well.\u00a0So they've got the talent, they've got the entrepreneurial spirit.\u00a0The question is, how do we make sure that they're succeeding here in their home countries?\u00a0The continent is rich in natural resources.\u00a0And from cell phone entrepreneurs to small farmers, Africans have shown the capacity and commitment to create their own opportunities.\u00a0But old habits must also be broken. Dependence on commodities -- or a single export -- has a tendency to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and leaves people too vulnerable to downturns.So in Ghana, for instance, oil brings great opportunities, and you have been very responsible in preparing for new revenue.\u00a0But as so many Ghanaians know, oil cannot simply become the new cocoa.\u00a0From South Korea to Singapore, history shows that countries thrive when they invest in their people and in their infrastructure; when they promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled workforce, and create space for small and medium-sized businesses that create jobs.As Africans reach for this promise, America will be more responsible in extending our hand.\u00a0By cutting costs that go to Western consultants and administration, we want to put more resources in the hands of those who need it, while training people to do more for themselves.\u00a0\u00a0That's why our 3.5 billion dollar food security initiative is focused on new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa.\u00a0Aid is not an end in itself.\u00a0The purpose of foreign assistance must be creating the conditions where it's no longer needed.\u00a0I want to see Ghanaians not only self-sufficient in food, I want to see you exporting food to other countries and earning money.\u00a0You can do that.Now, America can also do more to promote trade and investment.  Wealthy nations must open our doors to goods and services from Africa in a meaningful way.\u00a0That will be a commitment of my Administration.\u00a0And where there is good governance, we can broaden prosperity through public-private partnerships that invest in better roads and electricity; capacity-building that trains people to grow a business; financial services that reach not just the cities but also the poor and rural areas.\u00a0This is also in our own interests -- for if people are lifted out of poverty and wealth is created in Africa, guess what?\u00a0New markets will open up for our own goods.\u00a0So it's good for both.One area that holds out both undeniable peril and extraordinary promise is energy.\u00a0Africa gives off less greenhouse gas than any other part of the world, but it is the most threatened by climate change.\u00a0A warming planet will spread disease, shrink water resources, and deplete crops, creating conditions that produce more famine and more conflict.\u00a0All of us -- particularly the developed world -- have a responsibility to slow these trends -- through mitigation, and by changing the way that we use energy.\u00a0But we can also work with Africans to turn this crisis into opportunity.Together, we can partner on behalf of our planet and prosperity, and help countries increase access to power while skipping -- leapfrogging the dirtier phase of development.\u00a0Think about it:\u00a0Across Africa, there is bountiful wind and solar power; geothermal energy and biofuels.\u00a0From the Rift Valley to the North African deserts; from the Western coasts to South Africa's crops -- Africa's boundless natural gifts can generate its own power, while exporting profitable, clean energy abroad.These steps are about more than growth numbers on a balance sheet.\u00a0They're about whether a young person with an education can get a job that supports a family; a farmer can transfer their goods to market; an entrepreneur with a good idea can start a business.\u00a0It's about the dignity of work; it's about the opportunity that must exist for Africans in the 21st century.Just as governance is vital to opportunity, it's also critical to the third area I want to talk about:\u00a0strengthening public health.In recent years, enormous progress has been made in parts of Africa.\u00a0Far more people are living productively with HIV/AIDS, and getting the drugs they need.\u00a0I just saw a wonderful clinic and hospital that is focused particularly on maternal health.\u00a0But too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them.\u00a0When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite, and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made.Yet because of incentives -- often provided by donor nations -- many African doctors and nurses go overseas, or work for programs that focus on a single disease.\u00a0And this creates gaps in primary care and basic prevention.\u00a0Meanwhile, individual Africans also have to make responsible choices that prevent the spread of disease, while promoting public health in their communities and countries.So across Africa, we see examples of people tackling these problems.\u00a0In Nigeria, an Interfaith effort of Christians and Muslims has set an example of cooperation to confront malaria.\u00a0Here in Ghana and across Africa, we see innovative ideas for filling gaps in care -- for instance, through E-Health initiatives that allow doctors in big cities to support those in small towns.America will support these efforts through a comprehensive, global health strategy, because in the 21st century, we are called to act by our conscience but also by our common interest, because when a child dies of a preventable disease in Accra, that diminishes us everywhere.\u00a0And when disease goes unchecked in any corner of the world, we know that it can spread across oceans and continents.And that's why my Administration has committed 63 billion dollars to meet these challenges -- 63 billion dollars.\u00a0\u00a0Building on the strong efforts of President Bush, we will carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS.\u00a0We will pursue the goal of ending deaths from malaria and tuberculosis, and we will work to eradicate polio.\u00a0\u00a0We will fight -- we will fight neglected tropical disease.\u00a0And we won't confront illnesses in isolation -- we will invest in public health systems that promote wellness and focus on the health of mothers and children.Now, as we partner on behalf of a healthier future, we must also stop the destruction that comes not from illness, but from human beings -- and so the final area that I will address is conflict.Let me be clear:\u00a0Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at perpetual war.\u00a0But if we are honest, for far too many Africans, conflict is a part of life, as constant as the sun.\u00a0There are wars over land and wars over resources.\u00a0And it is still far too easy for those without conscience to manipulate whole communities into fighting among faiths and tribes.These conflicts are a millstone around Africa's neck. Now, we all have many identities -- of tribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality.\u00a0But defining oneself in opposition to someone who belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21st century.\u00a0\u00a0Africa's diversity should be a source of strength, not a cause for division.\u00a0We are all God's children.\u00a0We all share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to access education and opportunity; to love our families and our communities and our faith.\u00a0That is our common humanity.That is why we must stand up to inhumanity in our midst.\u00a0It is never justified -- never justifiable to target innocents in the name of ideology.\u00a0\u00a0It is the death sentence of a society to force children to kill in wars.\u00a0It is the ultimate mark of criminality and cowardice to condemn women to relentless and systemic rape.\u00a0We must bear witness to the value of every child in Darfur and the dignity of every woman in the Congo.\u00a0No faith or culture should condone the outrages against them.\u00a0And all of us must strive for the peace and security necessary for progress.Africans are standing up for this future.\u00a0Here, too, in Ghana we are seeing you help point the way forward. Ghanaians should take pride in your contributions to peacekeeping from Congo to Liberia to Lebanon -- and your efforts to resist the scourge of the drug trade.\u00a0\u00a0We welcome the steps that are being taken by organizations like the African Union and ECOWAS to better resolve conflicts, to keep the peace, and support those in need.\u00a0And we encourage the vision of a strong, regional security architecture that can bring effective, transnational forces to bear when needed.America has a responsibility to work with you as a partner to advance this vision, not just with words, but with support that strengthens African capacity.\u00a0When there's a genocide in Darfur or terrorists in Somalia, these are not simply African problems -- they are global security challenges, and they demand a global response.And that's why we stand ready to partner through diplomacy and technical assistance and logistical support, and we will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable.\u00a0And let me be clear:\u00a0Our Africa Command is focused not on establishing a foothold in the continent, but on confronting these common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa, and the world.</p><p>In Moscow, I spoke of the need for an international system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed.\u00a0And that must include a commitment to support those who resolve conflicts peacefully, to sanction and stop those who don't, and to help those who have suffer -- suffered.\u00a0But ultimately, it will be vibrant democracies like Botswana and Ghana which roll back the causes of conflict and advance the frontiers of peace and prosperity.As I said earlier, Africa's future is up to Africans.The people of Africa are ready to claim that future.\u00a0And in my country, African Americans -- including so many recent immigrants -- have thrived in every sector of society.\u00a0We've done so despite a difficult past, and we've drawn strength from our African heritage.\u00a0With strong institutions and a strong will, I know that Africans can live their dreams in Nairobi and Lagos, Kigali, Kinshasa, Harare, and right here in Accra.You know, 52 years ago, the eyes of the world were on Ghana.\u00a0And a young preacher named </p><p>Martin Luther King traveled here, to Accra, to watch the Union Jack come down and the Ghanaian flag go up.\u00a0This was before the march on Washington or the success of the civil rights movement in my country.\u00a0Dr. King was asked how he felt while watching the birth of a nation.\u00a0And he said:\u00a0\"It renews my conviction in the ultimate triumph of justice.\"3Now that triumph must be won once more, and it must be won by you.\u00a0\u00a0And I am particularly speaking to the young people all across Africa and right here in Ghana.\u00a0In places like Ghana, young people make up over half of the population.And here is what you must know:\u00a0The world will be what you make of it.\u00a0You have the power to hold your leaders accountable, and to build institutions that serve the people.\u00a0You can serve in your communities, and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world.\u00a0You can conquer disease, and end conflicts, and make change from the bottom up.\u00a0You can do that.\u00a0Yes you can -- because in this moment, history is on the move.But these things can only be done if all of you take responsibility for your future.\u00a0And it won't be easy.\u00a0It will take time and effort.\u00a0There will be suffering and setbacks.\u00a0But I can promise you this:\u00a0America will be with you every step of the way -- as a partner, as a friend.\u00a0\u00a0Opportunity won't come from any other place, though.\u00a0It must come from the decisions that all of you make, the things that you do, the hope that you hold in your heart.Ghana, freedom is your inheritance.\u00a0Now, it is your responsibility to build upon freedom's foundation.\u00a0And if you do, we will look back years from now to places like Accra and say this was the time when the promise was realized; this was the moment when prosperity was forged, when pain was overcome, and a new era of progress began. This can be the time when we witness the triumph of justice once more.\u00a0Yes we can.Thank you very much.\u00a0God bless you.Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type":

General", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Good morning, everybody.\u00a0 Before I introduce America's next Surgeon General, I'd like to say a few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will help oversee.We are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been.\u00a0 Over the last several weeks, key committees in the House and the Senate have made important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, and curb the worst practices of the insurance companies.\u00a0 It's a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade.\u00a0 Let me repeat that:\u00a0 It is a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid.Even though we are close, I've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finish line.\u00a0 There are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said and done.\u00a0 But health care reform must be done.I know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a more incremental approach, or simply do nothing.\u00a0 But this is the kind of criticism we heard when the country tried to pass Medicare, a program that is now providing quality care to generations of American seniors.\u00a0 It's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millions of kids.\u00a0 It's the same Washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off tough decisions for decades.\u00a0 And it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into the current predicament.So make no mistake:\u00a0 The status quo on health care is no longer an option for the United States of America.\u00a0 If we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children a legacy of debt -- a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, and because we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, will crush our government.\u00a0 Premiums will continue to skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another tax on American families struggling to pay bills.\u00a0 The insurance companies and special interests that have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more -- and they'll continue to deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.\u00a0 People will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs.This is a future that we cannot afford.\u00a0 This country can't afford to have health care premiums rise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade.\u00a0 We can't afford 14,000 Americans losing their health care every single day.\u00a0 We can't afford a future where our government will eventually spend more on Medicare and Medicaid than what we spend on everything else.And during the campaign, I promised health care reform that would control costs, expand coverage, and ensure choice.\u00a0 And I promised that Americans making $250,000 a year or less would not pay more in taxes.\u00a0 These are promises that we're keeping as reform moves forward.This is no longer a problem we can wait to fix.\u00a0 This is about who we are as a country.\u00a0 Health care reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy.So I just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the week that I was gone:\u00a0 We are going to get this done.\u00a0 Inaction is not an option.\u00a0 And for those nay-sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us.\u00a0 We are going to make this thing happen, because the American people desperately need it.And even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that if premiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it's unsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where Medicare and Medicaid are going, then inaction will create the biggest crisis of all.And so I understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change.\u00a0 The muscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folks back into shape.\u00a0 We are going to get this done.\u00a0 And if there's anyone who understands the urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who will become our nation's next Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin.The list of qualifications that make Dr. Benjamin an outstanding candidate to be America's leading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed.\u00a0 She was in the second class at Morehouse School of Medicine and went on to earn an MD from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an MBA from Tulane.\u00a0 She served as Associate Dean for Rural Health at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine, and in 1995, she became the first physician under 40 and the first African American woman to be named to the American Medical Association's Board of Trustees.\u00a0 In 2002, she became President of Alabama's State Medical Association.\u00a0 And she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the MacArthur Genius Award.\u00a0 It's very impressive.But of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today's challenges or closer to Regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuilt in Bayou La Batre -- did I say that right?\u00a0 Well, tell me how to say it.</p><p>Dr. Benjamin:\u00a0 Bayou La Batre.</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 Bayou La Batre.\u00a0 That's in Alabama, people.Bayou La Batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people.\u00a0 It's a shrimping town, where a lot of folks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance.\u00a0 And by the way, Dr. Benjamin, while we were talking in the Oval Office, described for me the demographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks, and Asians in this community.\u00a0 There are a lot of Laotians and Cambodians who have moved there and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community.\u00a0 And like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by.\u00a0 And that's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community, Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened a small clinic in Bayou La Batre.When people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them.\u00a0 When the clinic wasn't making money, she didn't take a salary for herself. When Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998, she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt.\u00a0 When Hurricane Katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time.\u00a0 She tended to those who had been wounded in the storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way.And when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what Dr. Benjamin did.\u00a0 With help from her community, she is rebuilding it again.\u00a0 One disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside.\u00a0 Another elderly man said simply, \"Maybe I can help.\u00a0 I got a hammer.\"For nearly two decades, Dr. Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system.\u00a0 She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive.\u00a0 She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs, having treated too many costly and -- diseases and complications that didn't have to happen.\u00a0 And she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works.But for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, Regina Benjamin also represents what's best about health care in America -- doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients; those Americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen.\u00a0 Through floods and fires and severe want, Regina Benjamin has refused to give up.\u00a0 Her patients have refused to give up.\u00a0 And when we were talking in the Oval Office, she said:\u00a0 The one thing I want to do is make sure that this Surgeon General's Office gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; somebody is advocating for them and speaking for them.And now we in Washington and across America have to refuse to give up on the goal of health care that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us.\u00a0 We don't have to deal with hurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods and we don't have to deal with fires; all we have to do is pass a bill to make sure that the American people have a decent shot at getting the kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable.And I know that Dr. Benjamin is going to help us get there as the next Surgeon General.\u00a0 And I am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and Secretary Sebelius is equally excited, even though she's just standing here.With that, let me introduce the next Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Regina Benjamin.\u00a0</p><p></p><p>Dr. Regina Benjamin's Address on Surgeon General Nomination</p><p></p><p>Dr. Regina Benjamin's Address on Surgeon General Nomination</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Macomb Community College, Warren, Michigan", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "American Graduation Initiative Speech", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Hello, Michigan!\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 First of all, give Joe a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction.\u00a0We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody has chairs, go ahead and use them.\u00a0Feel free.\u00a0 We've got some special guests here today that I just want to acknowledge.\u00a0 All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that you have a chance to see them.</p><p>First of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a big round of applause.\u00a0Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- give John a big round of applause.\u00a0 One of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of working families each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow.\u00a0 We've got Speaker of the House, Andy Dillon, in the house.\u00a0 We've got a lot of other local elected officials, and I just want to thank them.</p><p>A couple of people who are missing:\u00a0 Carl Levin, who is doing great work.\u00a0 He's in the Senate right now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch of necessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending.\u00a0 So he's the point person on it.\u00a0 The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to get this bill done.\u00a0 Please give him a big round of applause.\u00a0 Congressman Sandy Levin, also working hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.\u00a0 I want to go ahead and acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ball player.\u00a0My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling skills -- or the endurance.\u00a0 Also don't have the afro.\u00a0 Don't think I forgot that, Dave.\u00a0 I remember.\u00a0I remember that.</p><p>I also want to acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House Council on Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each and every day.\u00a0 He's traveling constantly back here -- Ed Montgomery.\u00a0 Please give Ed a big round of applause.</p><p>And the Chairman of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, Derek Bailey is here.\u00a0 Please give Derek a big round of applause.</p><p>And finally, the president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs.\u00a0 Give Jim Jacobs a big round of applause.</p><p>And those of you who I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here.\u00a0 And thank you all.\u00a0 It is wonderful to be back at Macomb.\u00a0 It was terrific visiting this campus as a candidate, but I have to admit, it's even better visiting as a President.</p><p>Now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take their career to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue their dream, right here in Macomb.\u00a0 This is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds -- even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can take a chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families.</p><p>There are folks like Joe, who just told us his story.\u00a0 When Joe lost his job, he decided to take advantage of assistance for displaced workers.\u00a0 He earned his associate degree here at Macomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add.\u00a0 And with the help of that degree, Joe found a new job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as a maintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought to make a fresh start.</p><p>There are workers like Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie?\u00a0 Raise your hand, Kellie.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 There you are.\u00a0 There's Kellie right there.\u00a0 Kellie is a UAW worker at a Ford plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.\u00a0 She used to drive a fork lift, right?\u00a0 But then she decided to train here at Macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's an apprentice pipe fitter.\u00a0 It's a telling example:\u00a0 Even as this painful restructuring takes place in our auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs.\u00a0 And Joe and Kellie's story make clear what all of you know:\u00a0 Community colleges are an essential part of our recovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future.\u00a0 This place can make the future better, not just for these individuals but for America.</p><p>Now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their jobs, and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been hard-hit.\u00a0 Now, I -- the statistics are daunting.\u00a0 The whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent.\u00a0 Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher.\u00a0 And new jobs of course are going to be coming out and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize.</p><p>Now, that's not just abstractions.\u00a0 Those just aren't numbers on a page.\u00a0 Those are extraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all their lives and have done the right things all their lives.\u00a0 If you haven't lost a job, chances are you know somebody who has:\u00a0 a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker.\u00a0 And you know that as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just a paycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do.\u00a0 That's part of what it means to be an American.\u00a0 We take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing, supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities.\u00a0 People need work not just for income, but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important.\u00a0 And so when you lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavy burden, that's a heavy weight.</p><p>Now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back on its feet.\u00a0 That's my job.\u00a0And it's a job I gladly accept.\u00a0 I love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy.\u00a0 That's fine.\u00a0 Give it to me.\u00a0 My job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe.</p><p>So I welcome the job.\u00a0 I want the responsibility.\u00a0 And I know that -- let's just take an example.\u00a0 Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier this year.\u00a0 Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable for those decisions.\u00a0 I agree that they should be held accountable.\u00a0 But I also recognize the historic significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all across Michigan and all across the country.</p><p>I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connected to the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especially right here in Michigan.\u00a0 So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a process worth supporting.</p><p>Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy.\u00a0 Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it?\u00a0 They've gotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible.\u00a0 They've got a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century.\u00a0 Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders:\u00a0 workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.\u00a0 And together, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible.</p><p>It was the right thing to do.</p><p>But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.\u00a0 They're the casualties of a changing economy.\u00a0 In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselves means that some jobs aren't going to return.\u00a0 And that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create.\u00a0 For even before this recession hit, we were faced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-paying jobs.</p><p>So now is the time to change all that.\u00a0 What we face is far more than a passing crisis.\u00a0 This is a transformative moment.\u00a0 And in this moment we must do what other generations have done.\u00a0 It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions.\u00a0 That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- to change that mindset.\u00a0 Now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth that will not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in a global economy.\u00a0 To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt.\u00a0 We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a major debate over the next three weeks.\u00a0 And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care system.\u00a0 We have no choice but to change the health care system, because right now it's broken for too many Americans.</p><p>We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.\u00a0 But don't let folks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health care costs, which is why we need reform.</p><p>Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new clean energy economy.\u00a0 And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of this as the governor of Michigan.\u00a0 She is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got to support her in that effort.</p><p>I want Michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants and energy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, Michigan, you know bad weather.\u00a0 So you can be all on top of weatherizing.\u00a0 You need to weatherize.\u00a0 I know about that in Chicago too.</p><p>But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs of the 21st century.\u00a0 We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in this global economy.\u00a0Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, we have prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential of a skilled American workforce.\u00a0 That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, but also our entire economy.\u00a0 That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill which helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity.\u00a0 That was the foundation for the American middle class.</p><p>And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America:\u00a0 By 2020, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\u00a0 We used to have that.\u00a0 We're going to have it again.\u00a0And we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal.\u00a0 Already we've increased Pell grants by $500.\u00a0We've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of college tuition.\u00a0We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a job that you just lost.\u00a0A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a new life -- in a new economy.\u00a0 And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls -- which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all across America.\u00a0 So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China and India and everybody else all around the world.</p><p>But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.\u00a0 We're going to achieve this in the next 10 years.\u00a0 And it's called the American Graduation Initiative.\u00a0 It will reform and strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resources that students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand.\u00a0 Through this plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade -- 5 million.</p><p>Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commission on Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step on behalf of community colleges in America.\u00a0 And let me be clear:\u00a0 We pay for this plan -- this isn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans.\u00a0 That will save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.\u00a0 Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went towards the interests of higher education in America.\u00a0 That's what my administration is committed to doing.</p><p>Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as a silver bullet and college as a cure-all.\u00a0 It's not, and we know that.\u00a0 I can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, \"Training for what?\"\u00a0 So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there.</p><p>But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience.\u00a0 We will not fill those jobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by community colleges.\u00a0 That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behind program.\u00a0 It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities across the state.\u00a0 The rest of the country should learn from the effort.</p><p>This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or a nurse.\u00a0 In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges.\u00a0 This is training to install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop a smarter electricity grid.\u00a0 And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans are using to improve their skills and broaden their horizons.\u00a0 Many young people are saving money by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college.\u00a0 And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge at schools like this one.</p><p>At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls.\u00a0 And this is in addition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.\u00a0 So community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country.\u00a0 Not only is that not right, it's not smart.\u00a0 That's why I've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, but who is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote community colleges and help us make community colleges stronger.\u00a0 And that's why we're putting in place this American Graduation Initiative.</p><p>Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do.\u00a0 Number one, we will offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal funding.\u00a0 We'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs with businesses that are looking to hire.\u00a0 We'll challenge these schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that are essential to our competitiveness.\u00a0 We'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.</p><p>These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.\u00a0 We've seen Cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to health IT.\u00a0 We know that the most successful community colleges are those that partner with the private sector.\u00a0 So we want to encourage more companies to work with schools to build these type of relationships.\u00a0 That way, when somebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training.</p><p>We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission:\u00a0 to measure what works and what doesn't.\u00a0 All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office.\u00a0 And that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.\u00a0 And schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive -- achieve results and which programs don't.\u00a0 And this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, but for students and workers, as well.\u00a0 If a parent is going to spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- that degree really has to mean something.\u00a0 They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals.\u00a0 If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire.</p><p>In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program.\u00a0 See, more than half -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail to reach their goal.\u00a0 That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students.\u00a0 Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still have to pay back the debt.\u00a0 And it's a disaster for our economy.</p><p>So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.\u00a0 Let's figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers.\u00a0 Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.\u00a0 Maybe a young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to employment.\u00a0 The point is, we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential.</p><p>All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative.\u00a0 The second part:\u00a0 We're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country.\u00a0All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the higher education system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all.\u00a0 And that means schools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st century economy, they're years behind in the education they can offer.\u00a0 That's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct.\u00a0 Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country.\u00a0 And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what?\u00a0 You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those schools.\u00a0 So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan right here right now.</p><p>Number three:\u00a0 Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer.\u00a0 So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building more classrooms.\u00a0 And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty.\u00a0 And this will make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.\u00a0 We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to try it because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job.</p><p>So let me say this more:\u00a0 The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard.\u00a0 It was never going to be easy.\u00a0 When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lost that month.\u00a0 Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months.\u00a0 Now we've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs.\u00a0 We will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're actually creating jobs.</p><p>And it's going to take time.\u00a0 There are going to be false starts and there are going to be setbacks.\u00a0 But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's what we've always done.\u00a0 That's what America does.\u00a0 We hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.\u00a0 That's what we see on display right here at Macomb Community College.\u00a0 That's what I've seen at colleges and universities all across this country.\u00a0 At every juncture in our history when we've been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-do American spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.</p><p>That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficult moment, are taking responsibility for theirs.</p><p>I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come.</p><p>Thank you very much, Warren.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-82.9729967, 42.5052545]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": NaN, "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Eulogy for Ted Kennedy", "article": "<p>Your Eminence, Vicki, Kara, Edward, Patrick, Curran, Caroline, members of the Kennedy family, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remember their son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of the Democratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate - a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws, and who penned more than three hundred himself. </p><p>But those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held: Father. Brother. Husband. Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews, \"The Grand Fromage,\" or \"The Big Cheese.\" I, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearly half a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend.Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became its rock. He was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how to brush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy got back in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a press conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, \"It'll be the same in Washington.\"This spirit of resilience and good humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken violently from the country that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. He narrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible.It is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to let himself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that. But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he told us, \"...[I]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - and no exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves.\" Indeed, Ted was the \"Happy Warrior\" that the poet William Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote:As tempted more; more able to endure,As more exposed to suffering and distress;Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others - the sick child who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that he championed -- the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's health care, the Family and Medical Leave Act -all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or special connections. It was to give a voice to those who were not heard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow. </p><p>We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prism through which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect - a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots. And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, but also by seeking compromise and common cause - not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, but through friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for the Children's Health Insurance Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrin had written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crusty Republican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas Committee Chairman on an immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only the Chairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he would inch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would pull it back. Before long, the deal was done.It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate for my support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave him my pledge, but expressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes it needed, and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He just patted me on the back, and said \"Luck of the Irish!\"Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago, his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time. Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, \"What did Webster do?\"But though it is Ted Kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that we will miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, \"I'm sorry for your loss,\" or \"I hope you feel better,\" or \"What can I do to help?\" It was the boss who was so adored by his staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a U.S. Senator would take the time to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings in my private study - a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire it when Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that's my second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of those stories - the ones that often start with \"You wouldn't believe who called me today.\"Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's as well. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, \"On you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared. We are all going to make it because you were always there with your love.\"Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love - he made it because of theirs; and especially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, it could not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. That he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would often acknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days. We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings.This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same about himself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy - not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for the people and the country he loved.In the days after September 11th, Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families of this state who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept calling and checking up on them. He fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing, played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible day came along. To one widow, he wrote the following:\"As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because there is still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us.\"We carry on. Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At last he is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the good he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image - the image of a man on a boat; white mane tousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Arlington, Virginia", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Back-to-School Speech to America's Schoolchildren", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. All right, everybody go ahead and have a seat. How is everybody doing today? How about Tim Spicer? I am here with students at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. And we've got students tuning in from all across America, from kindergarten through 12th grade. And I am just so glad that all could join us today. And I want to thank Wakefield for being such an outstanding host. Give yourselves a big round of applause.</p><p>I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you in kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it's understandable if you're a little nervous. I imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now -- with just one more year to go. And no matter what grade you're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could've stayed in bed just a little bit longer this morning.I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived overseas. I lived in Indonesia for a few years. And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the American kids went to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an American education. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. But because she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning.Now, as you might imagine, I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. And a lot of times, I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and she'd say, \"This is no picnic for me either, buster.\"</p><p>So I know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here today because I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here because I want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year.Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education. And I've talked about responsibility a lot.I've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn.I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox.I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, and supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve.But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools, unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. That's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education.I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something that you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide.Maybe you could be a great writer -- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that English paper -- that English class paper that's assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine -- but you might not know it until you do your project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a Supreme Court justice -- but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team.And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job. You've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it.And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. The future of America depends on you. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future.You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment. You'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy.We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect so you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you don't do that -- if you quit on school -- you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country.Now, I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork.I get it. I know what it's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had. There were times when I missed having a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I didn't fit in.So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been on school, and I did some things I'm not proud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse.But I was -- I was lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to go to college and law school and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, she has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot of money. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country.Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has lost their job and there's not enough money to go around. Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right.But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where you come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home -- none of that is an excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school. That's no excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. There is no excuse for not trying.Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written your destiny for you, because here in America, you write your own destiny. You make your own future.That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America.Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she first started school. Neither of her parents had gone to college. But she worked hard, earned good grades, and got a scholarship to Brown University -- is now in graduate school, studying public health, on her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez.I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain cancer since he was three. He's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affected his memory, so it took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his schoolwork. But he never fell behind. He's headed to college this fall.And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed to get a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs, and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college.And Jazmin, Andoni, and Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They face challenges in their lives just like you do. In some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you. But they refused to give up. They chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education, and set goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same.That's why today I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- and do everything you can to meet them. Your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book. Maybe you'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community. Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all young people deserve a safe environment to study and learn. Maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn. And along those lines, by the way, I hope all of you are washing your hands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.But whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it.I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successful without any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star. Chances are you're not going to be any of those things.The truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject that you study. You won't click with every teacher that you have. Not every homework assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try.That's okay. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures. J.K. Rowling's -- who wrote Harry Potter -- her first Harry Potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career. But he once said, \"I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's why I succeed.\"These people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you -- you have to let your failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differently the next time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying.No one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first time you sing a song. You've got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to read something a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you to learn something new. So find an adult that you trust -- a parent, a grandparent or teacher, a coach or a counselor -- and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals.And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best.It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a revolution and they founded this nation. Young people. Students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Google and Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other.So today, I want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems are you going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a President who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country?Now, your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions. I'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn. But you've got to do your part, too. So I expect all of you to get serious this year. I expect you to put your best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don't let us down. Don't let your family down or your country down. Most of all, don't let yourself down. Make us all proud.Thank you very much, everybody.God bless you. God bless America.</p><p>Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.1067698, 38.8799697]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Lincoln Center, New York, NY", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Eulogy for \n\t\tWalter Cronkite", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]To Chip, Kathy, and Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; to Walter's friends, colleagues, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of the Intrepid; to all of you who are gathered here today; I am honored to be here to pay tribute to the life and times of the man who chronicled our time.I did not know Mr. Cronkite personally.\u00a0 And my regret is made more acute by the stories that have been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did I know him any better than the tens of millions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question:\u00a0 \"What happened today?\"\u00a0 But like them and like all of you, I have benefited as a citizen from his dogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view that journalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy.Even in his early career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favor of getting it right.\u00a0 He wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting it right.\u00a0 During one of his first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to go on the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much he loved fires -- a massive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives.\u00a0 When Walter reached for the telephone, his boss asked, \"What are you doing; get on the air!\"\u00a0 Walter replied that he was calling the fire department to confirm the story.\u00a0 \"You don't need to confirm it,\" the manager shouted, \"my wife is watching the whole thing!\"Needless to say, Walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the air himself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that it had been nothing more than a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries.\u00a0 He lost his job -- but he got the story right.Walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared to compromise his integrity.\u00a0 He got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of one another's motives.\u00a0 One politician once remarked, \"Walter, my friend, you've got to believe me, fully 85 percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth.\"He shared a complicated relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on their side even as they were convinced that he wasn't.\u00a0 President Johnson called Walter after the evening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story.\u00a0 But Walter knew that if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job.His endless inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother who sold encyclopedias for a living.\u00a0 As a boy, Walter spent countless hours getting lost within their pages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from one another, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked.And that's the way he lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to make sense of it and explaining it to others.\u00a0 He went everywhere and he did everything.\u00a0 He raced cars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feet below the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and experienced weightlessness in the upper reaches of our atmosphere -- all with one mission:\u00a0 to make it come alive for the rest of us.And as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes.\u00a0 He was forever there, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal and success; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know.\u00a0 He was a voice of certainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain.\u00a0 And through it all, he never lost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in the heartland.\u00a0 He was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of us personally.So it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America.\u00a0 But here's the thing:\u00a0 That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network.\u00a0 We weren't told to believe it by some advertising campaign.\u00a0 It was earned.\u00a0 It was earned by year after year and decade after decade of painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his belief that the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied by theatre or spectacle.\u00a0 He didn't believe in dumbing down.\u00a0 He trusted us.When he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America, he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife.\u00a0 When people of both political parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for his stances on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential opponents.\u00a0 And when, even a decade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories for television journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category, \"attractiveness.\"Through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments of deepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling the story of the American age.And this is how we remember him today.\u00a0 But we also remember and celebrate the journalism that Walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which so many of you have committed your careers.\u00a0 It's a standard that's a little bit harder to find today.\u00a0 We know that this is a difficult time for journalism.\u00a0 Even as appetites for news and information grow, newsrooms are closing.\u00a0 Despite the big stories of our era, serious journalists find themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has shrunk, so has the bottom line.And too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softer stories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism he championed.\u00a0 \"What happened today?\" is replaced with \"Who won today?\"\u00a0 The public debate cheapens.\u00a0 The public trust falters.\u00a0 We fail to understand our world or one another as well as we should \u0096- and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation.\u00a0 We seem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as a society.\u00a0 Which price is higher to pay?\u00a0 Which cost is harder to bear?\"This democracy,\" Walter said, \"cannot function without a reasonably well-informed electorate.\"\u00a0 That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of you pursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society:\u00a0 Our future depends on it.\u00a0Walter was no naive idealist.\u00a0 He understood the challenges and the pressures and the temptations facing journalism in this new era.\u00a0 He believed that a media company has an obligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and public affairs.\u00a0 He was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world of journalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it.Naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories of our time.\u00a0 In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at the speed of the Internet, would he still have called to double-check?\u00a0 Would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and the sound bites to shine the bright light on substance?\u00a0 Would he still offer the perspective that we value?\u00a0 Would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindling attention spans and omnipresent media?And somehow, we know that the answer is yes.\u00a0 The simple values Walter Cronkite set out in pursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could -- they are as vital today as they ever were.Our American story continues.\u00a0 It needs to be told.\u00a0 And if we choose to live up to Walter's example, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself as part of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve to value it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a false one -- and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead.Walter Cronkite invited a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust.\u00a0 That's why so many of you entered the profession in the first place.\u00a0 That's why the standards he set for journalists still stand.\u00a0 And that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved and valued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society.He's reunited with his beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold with boundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful \"oh, boy!\"\u00a0 We are grateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us to say that, yes, we, too, were there.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-73.9834889, 40.7724641]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": NaN, "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Joint Session of Congress Heath Care Speech", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, and the American people:</p><p></p><p>When I spoke here last winter, this nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u00a0 We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs per month.\u00a0 Credit was frozen.\u00a0 And our financial system was on the verge of collapse.\u00a0</p><p>As any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you, we are by no means out of the woods.\u00a0 A full and vibrant recovery is still many months away.\u00a0 And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them -- until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive; until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes.\u00a0 That is our ultimate goal.\u00a0 But thanks to the bold and decisive action we've taken since January, I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink.</p><p>I want to thank the members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months, and especially those who've taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery.\u00a0 I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our nation.\u00a0</p><p>But we did not come here just to clean up crises.\u00a0 We came here to build a future. So tonight, I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future -- and that is the issue of health care.\u00a0</p><p>I am not the first President to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.\u00a0 It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for health care reform.\u00a0 And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way.\u00a0 A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943.\u00a0 Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.</p><p>Our collective failure to meet this challenge -- year after year, decade after decade -- has led us to the breaking point.\u00a0 Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.\u00a0 These are not primarily people on welfare.\u00a0 These are middle-class Americans.\u00a0 Some can't get insurance on the job.\u00a0 Others are self-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer.\u00a0 Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or too expensive to cover.\u00a0</p><p>We are the only democracy -- the only advanced democracy on Earth -- the only wealthy nation -- that allows such hardship for millions of its people.\u00a0 There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage.\u00a0 In just a two-year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point.\u00a0 And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage.\u00a0 In other words, it can happen to anyone.</p><p>But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem for the uninsured.\u00a0 Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today.\u00a0\u00a0 More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. \u00a0More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care.\u00a0 It happens every day.</p><p>One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about.\u00a0 They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it.\u00a0 Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.\u00a0 By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer had more than doubled in size.\u00a0 That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.</p><p>Then there's the problem of rising cost.\u00a0 We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it.\u00a0 This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.\u00a0 It's why so many employers -- especially small businesses -- are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely.\u00a0 It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally -- like our automakers -- are at a huge disadvantage.\u00a0 And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it -- about $1,000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care.\u00a0</p><p>Finally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers.\u00a0 When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0 If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined.\u00a0 Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem.\u00a0 Nothing else even comes close.\u00a0 Nothing else.</p><p>Now, these are the facts.\u00a0 Nobody disputes them.\u00a0 We know we must reform this system.\u00a0 The question is how.\u00a0</p><p>There are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada's -- where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everybody.\u00a0 On the right, there are those who argue that we should end employer-based systems and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.</p><p>I've said -- I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both these approaches.\u00a0 But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the health care most people currently have.\u00a0 Since health care represents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch.\u00a0And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.\u00a0</p><p>During that time, we've seen Washington at its best and at its worst.\u00a0</p><p>We've seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform.\u00a0 Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week.\u00a0 That has never happened before.\u00a0 Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors' groups, and even drug companies -- many of whom opposed reform in the past.\u00a0 And there is agreement in this chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.\u00a0</p><p>But what we've also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have towards their own government.\u00a0 Instead of honest debate, we've seen scare tactics.\u00a0 Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise.\u00a0 Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge.\u00a0 And out of this blizzard of charges and counter-charges, confusion has reigned.\u00a0</p><p>Well, the time for bickering is over.\u00a0 The time for games has passed.\u00a0 Now is the season for action.\u00a0 Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do.\u00a0 Now is the time to deliver on health care.\u00a0 Now is the time to deliver on health care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals.\u00a0 It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance.\u00a0 It will provide insurance for those who don't.\u00a0 And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government.\u00a0 It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge -- not just government, not just insurance companies, but everybody including employers and individuals.\u00a0 And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from senators and congressmen, from Democrats and Republicans -- and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan.\u00a0 First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have.\u00a0Let me repeat this:\u00a0 Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\u00a0</p><p>What this plan will do is make the insurance you have work better for you.\u00a0 Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.\u00a0 As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it the most.\u00a0They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or in a lifetime.\u00a0We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick.\u00a0 And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies -- because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse.\u00a0 That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.</p><p>Now, that's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan -- more security and more stability.\u00a0</p><p>Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices.\u00a0If you lose your job or you change your job, you'll be able to get coverage.\u00a0 If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you'll be able to get coverage.\u00a0 We'll do this by creating a new insurance exchange -- a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices.\u00a0 Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers.\u00a0 As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage.\u00a0 This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance.\u00a0 It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance.\u00a0 And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we give ourselves.</p><p>Now, for those individuals and small businesses who still can't afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we'll provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need.\u00a0 And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned.\u00a0 This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right.\u00a0 In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have preexisting medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill.\u00a0This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should all embrace it.</p><p>Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those -- especially the young and the healthy -- who still want to take the risk and go without coverage.\u00a0 There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers by giving them coverage.\u00a0 The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money.\u00a0 If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for these people's expensive emergency room visits.\u00a0 If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors.\u00a0 And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek -- especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions -- just can't be achieved.\u00a0</p><p>And that's why under my plan, individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance -- just as most states require you to carry auto insurance.\u00a0Likewise -- likewise, businesses will be required to either offer their workers health care, or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers.\u00a0 There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still can't afford coverage, and 95 percent of all small businesses, because of their size and narrow profit margin, would be exempt from these requirements.\u00a0But we can't have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees.\u00a0 Improving our health care system only works if everybody does their part.</p><p>And while there remain some significant details to be ironed out, I believe -- I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined:\u00a0 consumer protections for those with insurance, an exchange that allows individuals and small businesses to purchase affordable coverage, and a requirement that people who can afford insurance get insurance.</p><p>And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life, as well as the economy as a whole.\u00a0 Still, given all the misinformation that's been spread over the past few months, I realize --I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform.\u00a0 So tonight I want to address some of the key controversies that are still out there.\u00a0</p><p>Some of people's concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost.\u00a0 The best example is the claim made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens.\u00a0 Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible.\u00a0 It is a lie, plain and simple.</p><p>There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would insure illegal immigrants.\u00a0 This, too, is false.\u00a0 The reforms -- the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.\u00a0</p><p>Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina:\u00a0 You lie!\u00a0</p><p>President Obama:\u00a0 It's not true.\u00a0 And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up -- under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\u00a0</p><p>Now, my health care proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a \"government takeover\" of the entire health care system.\u00a0 As proof, critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly sponsored insurance option, administered by the government just like Medicaid or Medicare.</p><p>So let me set the record straight here.\u00a0 My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition.\u00a0 That's how the market works.\u00a0 Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75 percent of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies.\u00a0 In Alabama, almost 90 percent is controlled by just one company.\u00a0 And without competition, the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down.\u00a0 And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly -- by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest, by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage, and by jacking up rates.</p><p>Insurance executives don't do this because they're bad people; they do it because it's profitable.\u00a0 As one former insurance executive testified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill, they are rewarded for it.\u00a0 All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called \"Wall Street's relentless profit expectations.\"</p><p>Now, I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business.\u00a0 They provide a legitimate service, and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors.\u00a0 I just want to hold them accountable.\u00a0And the insurance reforms that I've already mentioned would do just that.\u00a0 But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not-for-profit public option available in the insurance exchange.\u00a0Now, let me be clear.\u00a0 Let me be clear.\u00a0 It would only be an option for those who don't have insurance.\u00a0 No one would be forced to choose it, and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance.\u00a0 In fact, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, we believe that less than 5 percent of Americans would sign up.</p><p>Despite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don't like this idea.\u00a0 They argue that these private companies can't fairly compete with the government.\u00a0 And they'd be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option.\u00a0 But they won't be.\u00a0 I've insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects.\u00a0 But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits and excessive administrative costs and executive salaries, it could provide a good deal for consumers, and would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.</p><p>Now, it is -- it's worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I've proposed tonight.\u00a0 But its impact shouldn't be exaggerated -- by the left or the right or the media.\u00a0 It is only one part of my plan, and shouldn't be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles.\u00a0 To my progressive friends, I would remind you that for decades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage available for those without it.\u00a0The public option -- the public option is only a means to that end -- and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal.\u00a0 And to my Republican friends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government takeover of health care, we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have.</p><p>For example -- For example, some have suggested that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies.\u00a0 Others have proposed a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan.\u00a0 These are all constructive ideas worth exploring.\u00a0 But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans can't find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a choice.\u00a0 And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.</p><p>Finally, let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me, to members of this chamber, and to the public -- and that's how we pay for this plan.\u00a0</p><p>And here's what you need to know.\u00a0 First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits -- either now or in the future.\u00a0I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit, now or in the future, period.\u00a0 And to prove that I'm serious, there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize.\u00a0 Now, part of the reason I faced a trillion-dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for -- from the Iraq war to tax breaks for the wealthy.\u00a0I will not make that same mistake with health care.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Second, we've estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system, a system that is currently full of waste and abuse.\u00a0 Right now, too much of the hard-earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care don't make us any healthier.\u00a0 That's not my judgment -- it's the judgment of medical professionals across this country.\u00a0 And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, I want to speak directly to seniors for a moment, because Medicare is another issue that's been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.</p><p>More than four decades ago, this nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years.\u00a0 That's how Medicare was born.\u00a0 And it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next.\u00a0 And that is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.</p><p>The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies -- subsidies that do everything to pad their profits but don't improve the care of seniors.\u00a0 And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Now, these steps will ensure that you -- America's seniors -- get the benefits you've been promised.\u00a0 They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations.\u00a0 And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pockets for prescription drugs.\u00a0That's what this plan will do for you.\u00a0 So don't pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut, especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past and just this year supported a budget that would essentially have turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program.\u00a0 That will not happen on my watch.\u00a0 I will protect Medicare.</p><p>Now, because Medicare is such a big part of the health care system, making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver health care that can reduce costs for everybody.\u00a0 We have long known that some places -- like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania -- offer high-quality care at costs below average.\u00a0 So the commission can help encourage the adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system -- everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.\u00a0</p><p>Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan.\u00a0 Now, much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers.\u00a0 And this reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money -- an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts.\u00a0 And according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long run.\u00a0</p><p>Now, finally, many in this chamber -- particularly on the Republican side of the aisle -- have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of health care.\u00a0Now -- there you go.\u00a0 There you go.\u00a0 Now, I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but I've talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.So I'm proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine.\u00a0I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual states to test these ideas.\u00a0 I think it's a good idea, and I'm directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today.</p><p>Now, add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years -- less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.\u00a0 Now, most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent -- but spent badly -- in the existing health care system.\u00a0 The plan will not add to our deficit.\u00a0 The middle class will realize greater security, not higher taxes.\u00a0 And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of 1 percent each year -- one-tenth of 1 percent -- it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.</p><p>Now, this is the plan I'm proposing.\u00a0 It's a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight -- Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0 And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead.\u00a0 If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be there to listen.\u00a0 My door is always open.</p><p>But know this:\u00a0 I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than to improve it.\u00a0 I won't stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are.\u00a0 If you misrepresent what's in this plan, we will call you out.\u00a0And I will not -- and I will not accept the status quo as a solution.\u00a0 Not this time.\u00a0 Not now.</p><p>Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing.\u00a0 Our deficit will grow.\u00a0 More families will go bankrupt.\u00a0 More businesses will close.\u00a0 More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it the most.\u00a0 And more will die as a result.\u00a0 We know these things to be true.\u00a0</p><p>That is why we cannot fail.\u00a0 Because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed -- the ones who suffer silently, and the ones who shared their stories with us at town halls, in e-mails, and in letters.</p><p>I received one of those letters a few days ago.\u00a0 It was from our beloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy.\u00a0 He had written it back in May, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal.\u00a0 He asked that it be delivered upon his death.\u00a0</p><p>In it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks to the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, his amazing children, who are all here tonight.\u00a0 And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform -- \"that great unfinished business of our society,\" he called it -- would finally pass.\u00a0 He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity, but he also reminded me that \"it concerns more than material things.\"\u00a0 \"What we face,\" he wrote, \"is above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.\"</p><p>I've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days -- the character of our country.\u00a0 One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government.\u00a0 And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and, yes, sometimes angry debate.\u00a0 That's our history.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>For some of Ted Kennedy's critics, his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty.\u00a0 In their minds, his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.\u00a0</p><p>But those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here -- people of both parties -- know that what drove him was something more.\u00a0 His friend Orrin Hatch -- he knows that.\u00a0 They worked together to provide children with health insurance.\u00a0 His friend John McCain knows that.\u00a0 They worked together on a Patient's Bill of Rights.\u00a0 His friend Chuck Grassley knows that.\u00a0 They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities.\u00a0</p><p>On issues like these, Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience.\u00a0 It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer.\u00a0 He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick.\u00a0 And he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance, what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent, there is something that could make you better, but I just can't afford it.\u00a0</p><p>That large-heartedness -- that concern and regard for the plight of others -- is not a partisan feeling.\u00a0 It's not a Republican or a Democratic feeling.\u00a0 It, too, is part of the American character -- our ability to stand in other people's shoes; a recognition that we are all in this together, and when fortune turns against one of us, others are there to lend a helping hand; a belief that in this country, hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play; and an acknowledgment that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise.</p><p>This has always been the history of our progress.\u00a0 In 1935, when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism, but the men and women of Congress stood fast, and we are all the better for it.\u00a0 In 1965, when some argued that Medicare represented a government takeover of health care, members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- did not back down.\u00a0 They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>You see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem.\u00a0 They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom.\u00a0 But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, the vulnerable can be exploited.\u00a0 And they knew that when any government measure, no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial, is subject to scorn; when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un-American; when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom, and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter -- that at that point we don't merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges.\u00a0 We lose something essential about ourselves.</p><p>That was true then.\u00a0 It remains true today.\u00a0 I understand how difficult this health care debate has been.\u00a0 I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them.\u00a0 I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road -- to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one more term.\u00a0</p><p>But that is not what the moment calls for.\u00a0 That's not what we came here to do.\u00a0 We did not come to fear the future.\u00a0 We came here to shape it.\u00a0 I still believe we can act even when it's hard.\u00a0I still believe -- I still believe that we can act when it's hard.\u00a0 I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress.\u00a0 I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test.</p><p>Because that's who we are.\u00a0 That is our calling.\u00a0 That is our character.\u00a0 Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Arlington, Virginia",

friends of those that we lost this day: Michelle and I are deeply humbled to be with you.Eight Septembers have come and gone. Nearly 3,000 days have passed -- almost one for each of those taken from us. But no turning of the seasons can diminish the pain and the loss of that day. No passage of time and no dark skies can ever dull the meaning of this moment. </p><p>So on this solemn day, at this sacred hour, once more we pause. Once more we pray -- as a nation and as a people; in city streets where our two towers were turned to ashes and dust; in a quiet field where a plane fell from the sky; and here, where a single stone of this building is still blackened by the fires. We remember with reverence the lives we lost. We read their names. We press their photos to our hearts. And on this day that marks their death, we recall the beauty and meaning of their lives; men and women and children of every color and every creed, from across our nation and from more than 100 others. They were innocent. Harming no one, they went about their daily lives. Gone in a horrible instant, they now \"dwell in the House of the Lord forever.\"We honor all those who gave their lives so that others might live, and all the survivors who battled burns and wounds and helped each other rebuild their lives; men and women who gave life to that most simple of rules: I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.We pay tribute to the service of a new generation -- young Americans raised in a time of peace and plenty who saw their nation in its hour of need and said, \"I choose to serve\"; \"I will do my part.\" And once more we grieve. For you and your families, no words can ease the ache of your heart. No deeds can fill the empty places in your homes. But on this day and all that follow, you may find solace in the memory of those you loved, and know that you have the unending support of the American people.Scripture teaches us a hard truth. The mountains may fall and the earth may give way; the flesh and the heart may fail. But after all our suffering, God and grace will \"restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.\" So it is -- so it has been for these families. So it must be for our nation.Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this barbaric act and who plot against us still. In defense of our nation we will never waver; in pursuit of al Qaeda and its extremist allies, we will never falter. Let us renew our commitment to all those who serve in our defense -- our courageous men and women in uniform and their families and all those who protect us here at home. Mindful that the work of protecting America is never finished, we will do everything in our power to keep America safe.Let us renew the true spirit of that day. Not the human capacity for evil, but the human capacity for good. Not the desire to destroy, but the impulse to save, and to serve, and to build. On this first National Day of Service and Remembrance, we can summon once more that ordinary goodness of America -- to serve our communities, to strengthen our country, and to better our world. </p><p>Most of all, on a day when others sought to sap our confidence, let us renew our common purpose. Let us remember how we came together as one nation, as one people, as Americans, united not only in our grief, but in our resolve to stand with one another, to stand up for the country we all love. This may be the greatest lesson of this day, the strongest rebuke to those who attacked us, the highest tribute to those taken from us -- that such sense of purpose need not be a fleeting moment. It can be a lasting virtue.</p><p>For through their own lives -- and through you, the loved ones that they left behind -- the men and women who lost their lives eight years ago today leave a legacy that still shines brightly in the darkness, and that calls on all of us to be strong and firm and united. That is our calling today and in all the Septembers still to come.May God bless you and comfort you. And may God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.1067698, 38.8799697]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "New York, NY", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "United Nations 64th Session General Assembly Speech", "article": "<p>[as prepared for delivery]Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:It is my honor to address you for the first time as the 44th President of the United States.\u00a0 I -- I come before you humbled by the responsibility that the American people have placed upon me, mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history, and determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and abroad.I have been in office for just nine months -- though some days it seems a lot longer.\u00a0 I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world.\u00a0 These expectations are not about me.\u00a0 Rather, they are rooted, I believe, in a discontent with a status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences, and outpaced by our problems.\u00a0 But they are also rooted in hope -- the hope that real change is possible, and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.\u00a0 Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.\u00a0 Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others.\u00a0 And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.Now, like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the interest of my nation and my people, and I will never apologize for defending those interests.\u00a0 But it is my deeply held belief that in the year 2009 -- more than at any point in human history -- the interests of nations and peoples are shared.\u00a0 The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people, or they can tear us apart.\u00a0 The technology we harness can light the path to peace, or forever darken it.\u00a0 The energy we use can sustain our planet, or destroy it.\u00a0 What happens to the hope of a single child -- anywhere -- can enrich our world, or impoverish it.In this hall, we come from many places, but we share a common future.\u00a0 No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together.\u00a0 I have carried this message from London to Ankara; from Port of Spain to Moscow; from Accra to Cairo; and it is what I will speak about today -- because the time has come for the world to move in a new direction.\u00a0 We must embrace a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and our work must begin now.We know the future will be forged by deeds and not simply words.\u00a0 Speeches alone will not solve our problems -- it will take persistent action.\u00a0 For those who question the character and cause of my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete actions we have taken in just nine months.On my first day in office, I prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture by the United States of America.\u00a0 I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed, and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law.\u00a0 Every nation must know: America will live its values, and we will lead by example.We have set a clear and focused goal:\u00a0 to work with all members of this body to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies -- a network that has killed thousands of people of many faiths and nations, and that plotted to blow up this very building.\u00a0 In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we and many nations here are helping these governments develop the capacity to take the lead in this effort, while working to advance opportunity and security for their people.In Iraq, we are responsibly ending a war.\u00a0 We have removed American combat brigades from Iraqi cities, and set a deadline of next August to remove all our combat brigades from Iraqi territory.\u00a0 And I have made clear that we will help Iraqis transition to full responsibility for their future, and keep our commitment to remove all American troops by the end of 2011.I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.\u00a0 In Moscow, the United States and Russia announced that we would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic warheads and launchers.\u00a0 At the Conference on Disarmament, we agreed on a work plan to negotiate an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.\u00a0 And this week, my Secretary of State will become the first senior American representative to the annual Members Conference of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Upon taking office, I appointed a Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, and America has worked steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two states -- Israel and Palestine -- in which peace and security take root, and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians are respected.\u00a0\u00a0To confront climate change, we have invested $80 billion in clean energy.\u00a0 We have substantially increased our fuel-efficiency standards.\u00a0 We have provided new incentives for conservation, launched an energy partnership across the Americas, and moved from a bystander to a leader in international climate negotiations.To overcome an economic crisis that touches every corner of the world, we worked with the G20 nations to forge a coordinated international response of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the global economy back from the brink.\u00a0 We mobilized resources that helped prevent the crisis from spreading further to developing countries.\u00a0 And we joined with others to launch a $20 billion global food security initiative that will lend a hand to those who need it most, and help them build their own capacity.\u00a0We've also re-engaged the United Nations.\u00a0 We have paid our bills.\u00a0 We have joined the Human Rights Council.\u00a0 We have signed the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\u00a0 We have fully embraced the Millennium Development Goals.\u00a0 And we address our priorities here, in this institution\u00a0 -- for instance, through the Security Council meeting that I will chair tomorrow on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and through the issues that I will discuss today.This is what we have already done.\u00a0 But this is just a beginning.\u00a0 Some of our actions have yielded progress.\u00a0 Some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future.\u00a0 But make no mistake:\u00a0 This cannot solely be America's endeavor.\u00a0 Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.\u00a0 We have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the world.\u00a0 And now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.Now, if we are honest with ourselves, we need to admit that we are not living up to that responsibility.\u00a0 Consider the course that we're on if we fail to confront the status quo:\u00a0 Extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world; protracted conflicts that grind on and on; genocide; mass atrocities; more nations with nuclear weapons; melting ice caps and ravaged populations; persistent poverty and pandemic disease.\u00a0 I say this not to sow fear, but to state a fact:\u00a0 The magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions.This body was founded on the belief that the nations of the world could solve their problems together.\u00a0 Franklin Roosevelt, who died before he could see his vision for this institution become a reality, put it this way -- and I quote:\u00a0 \"The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man, or one party, or one nation\u0085.\u00a0 It cannot be a peace of large nations -- or of small nations.\u00a0 It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.\"The cooperative effort of the whole world.\u00a0 Those words ring even more true today, when it is not simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that we hold in common.\u00a0 Yet we also know that this body is made up of sovereign states.\u00a0 And sadly, but not surprisingly, this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground; a venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems. After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point figures -- point fingers and stoke divisions.\u00a0 Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles, and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions.\u00a0 Anybody can do that.\u00a0 Responsibility and leadership in the 21st century demand more.\u00a0In an era when our destiny is shared, power is no longer a zero-sum game.\u00a0 No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation.\u00a0 No world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed.\u00a0 No balance of power among nations will hold.\u00a0 The traditional divisions between nations of the South and the North make no sense in an interconnected world; nor do alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone Cold War.The time has come to realize that the old habits, the old arguments, are irrelevant to the challenges faced by our people. They lead nations to act in opposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue -- and to vote, often in this body, against the interests of their own people.\u00a0 They build up walls between us and the future that our people seek, and the time has come for those walls to come down.\u00a0 Together, we must build new coalitions that bridge old divides -- coalitions of different faiths and creeds; of north and south, east, west, black, white, and brown.The choice is ours.\u00a0 We can be remembered as a generation that chose to drag the arguments of the 20th century into the 21st; that put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were against instead of what we were for.\u00a0 Or we can be a generation that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead; that comes together to serve the common interests of human beings, and finally gives meaning to the promise embedded in the name given to this institution:\u00a0 the United Nations.That is the future America wants -- a future of peace and prosperity that we can only reach if we recognize that all nations have rights, but all nations have responsibilities as well.\u00a0 That is the bargain that makes this work.\u00a0 That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.Today, let me put forward four pillars that I believe are fundamental to the future that we want for our children:\u00a0 non-proliferation and disarmament; the promotion of peace and security; the preservation of our planet; and a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.First, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and seek the goal of a world without them.This institution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age, in part because man's capacity to kill had to be contained.\u00a0 For decades, we averted disaster, even under the shadow of a superpower stand-off.\u00a0 But today, the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity.\u00a0 If we fail to act, we will invite nuclear arms races in every region, and the prospect of wars and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine.A fragile consensus stands in the way of this frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain that shapes the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\u00a0 It says that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy; that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament; and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them.\u00a0 The next 12 months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve.America intends to keep our end of the bargain.\u00a0 We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launchers.\u00a0 We will move forward with ratification of the Test Ban Treaty, and work with others to bring the treaty into force so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited.\u00a0 We will complete a Nuclear Posture Review that opens the door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons.\u00a0 And we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for weapons.I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms each nation's responsibility to secure nuclear material on its territory, and to help those who can't -- because we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a violent extremist.\u00a0 And we will work to strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.All of this must support efforts to strengthen the NPT.\u00a0 Those nations that refuse to live up to their obligations must face consequences.\u00a0 Let me be clear, this is not about singling out individual nations -- it is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities.\u00a0 Because a world in which IAEA inspections are avoided and the United Nation's demands are ignored will leave all people less safe, and all nations less secure.In their actions to date, the governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope.\u00a0 We respect their rights as members of the community of nations.\u00a0 I've said before and I will repeat, I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations.But if the governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East -- then they must be held accountable.\u00a0 The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise, and that treaties will be enforced.\u00a0 We must insist that the future does not belong to fear.That brings me to the second pillar for our future:\u00a0 the pursuit of peace.The United Nations was born of the belief that the people of the world can live their lives, raise their families, and resolve their differences peacefully.\u00a0 And yet we know that in too many parts of the world, this ideal remains an abstraction -- a distant dream.\u00a0 We can either accept that outcome as inevitable, and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal, and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world.That effort must begin with an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men, women and children will never be tolerated.\u00a0 On this, no one can be -- there can be no dispute.\u00a0 The violent extremists who promote conflict by distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves.\u00a0 They offer nothing but hatred and destruction.\u00a0 In confronting them, America will forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share intelligence, and coordinate law enforcement and protect our people.\u00a0 We will permit no safe haven for al Qaeda to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation.\u00a0 We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we and many nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow.\u00a0 And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths, and new partnerships for opportunity.Our efforts to promote peace, however, cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists.\u00a0 For the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings -- the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin.And that is why we will support -- we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping, while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take hold.\u00a0 We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan through support for the people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve.\u00a0And in countries ravaged by violence -- from Haiti to Congo to East Timor -- we will work with the U.N. and other partners to support an enduring peace.I will also continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab world.\u00a0 We will continue to work on that issue.\u00a0 Yesterday, I had a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.\u00a0 We have made some progress.\u00a0 Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security.\u00a0 Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians.\u00a0 As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow.\u00a0 But more progress is needed.\u00a0 We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\u00a0The time has come -- the time has come to re-launch negotiations without preconditions that address the permanent status issues:\u00a0 security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem.\u00a0 And the goal is clear:\u00a0 Two states living side by side in peace and security -- a Jewish state of Israel, with true security for all Israelis; and a viable, independent Palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967, and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people.\u00a0 As we pursue this goal, we will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbors.\u00a0 In pursuit of that goal, we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral participation, alongside bilateral negotiations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, I am not na\u00efve.\u00a0 I know this will be difficult.\u00a0 But all of us -- not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us -- must decide whether we are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it lip service.\u00a0 To break the old patterns, to break the cycle of insecurity and despair, all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in private.\u00a0 The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians.\u00a0And -- And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security. We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us.\u00a0 It's not paid by politicians.\u00a0 It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night.\u00a0 It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own.\u00a0 These are all God's children.\u00a0 And after all the politics and all the posturing, this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security.\u00a0 That is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of Earth the Holy Land.\u00a0 And that is why, even though there will be setbacks and false starts and tough days, I will not waver in my pursuit of peace.\u00a0 Third, we must recognize that in the 21st century, there will be no peace unless we take responsibility for the preservation of our planet.\u00a0 And I thank the Secretary General for hosting the subject of climate change yesterday.The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied.\u00a0 Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred.\u00a0 If we continue down our current course, every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders.\u00a0 Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources.\u00a0 Development will be devastated by drought and famine.\u00a0 Land that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear.\u00a0 Future generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act; why we failed to pass on -- why we failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of our inheritance.And that is why the days when America dragged its feet on this issue are over.\u00a0 We will move forward with investments to transform our energy economy, while providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of energy.\u00a0 We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050.\u00a0 We will continue to promote renewable energy and efficiency, and share new technologies with countries around the world.\u00a0 And we will seize every opportunity for progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire world.\u00a0And those wealthy nations that did so much damage to the environment in the 20th century must accept our obligation to lead.\u00a0 But responsibility does not end there.\u00a0 While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast-growing carbon emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without inhibiting growth.\u00a0 And any effort that fails to help the poorest nations both adapt to the problems that climate change have already wrought and help them travel a path of clean development simply will not work.It's hard to change something as fundamental as how we use energy.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 It's even harder to do so in the midst of a global recession.\u00a0 Certainly, it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first.\u00a0 But we cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together.\u00a0 As we head into Copenhagen, let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for the sake of our common future.And this leads me to the final pillar that must fortify our future:\u00a0 a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.The world is still recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u00a0 In America, we see the engine of growth beginning to churn, and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay their bills.\u00a0 Across the globe, we find promising signs, but little certainty about what lies ahead.\u00a0 And far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises that challenge our humanity -- the despair of an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a treatable disease; or a mother losing her life as she gives birth.In Pittsburgh, we will work with the world's largest economies to chart a course for growth that is balanced and sustained.\u00a0 That means vigilance to ensure that we do not let up until our people are back to work.\u00a0 That means taking steps to rekindle demand so that global recovery can be sustained.\u00a0 And that means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all financial centers, so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.At a time of such interdependence, we have a moral and pragmatic interest, however, in broader questions of development -- the questions of development that existed even before this crisis happened.\u00a0 And so America will continue our historic effort to help people feed themselves.\u00a0 We have set aside $63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio, and to strengthen public health systems.\u00a0 We are joining with other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization.\u00a0 We will integrate more economies into a system of global trade.\u00a0 We will support the Millennium Development Goals, and approach next year's summit with a global plan to make them a reality.\u00a0 And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.Now is the time for all of us to do our part.\u00a0 Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all nations embrace their responsibilities.\u00a0 And that means that wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those with less, while reforming international institutions to give more nations a greater voice.\u00a0 And developing nations must root out the corruption that is an obstacle to progress -- for opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are oppressed and business have to pay bribes.\u00a0 That is why we support honest police and independent judges; civil society and a vibrant private sector.\u00a0 Our goal is simple:\u00a0 a global economy in which growth is sustained, and opportunity is available to all.Now, the changes that I've spoken about today will not be easy to make.\u00a0 And they will not be realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this, as useful as that may be.\u00a0 For as in any assembly of members, real change can only come through the people we represent.\u00a0 That is why we must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own capitals. That's where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use energy, and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.I believe that the people of the world want this future for their children.\u00a0 And that is why we must champion those principles which ensure that governments reflect the will of the people.\u00a0 These principles cannot be afterthoughts -- democracy and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I've discussed today, because governments of the people and by the people are more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people, rather than narrow interests of those in power.The test of our leadership will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our people.\u00a0 True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle dissent, or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home.\u00a0 The people of the world want change.\u00a0 They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.This Assembly's Charter commits each of us -- and I quote -- \"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women.\"\u00a0 Among those rights is the freedom to speak your mind and worship as you please; the promise of equality of the races, and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own potential; the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are governed, and to have confidence in the administration of justice.\u00a0 For just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another nation, no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their own people.\u00a0As an African American, I will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a more perfect union in my country.\u00a0 And that guides my belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, transformative change can be forged by those who choose to side with justice.\u00a0 And I pledge that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity and their rights -- for the student who seeks to learn; the voter who demands to be heard; the innocent who longs to be free; the oppressed who yearns to be equal.Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own path, and no path is perfect.\u00a0 Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions.\u00a0 And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy.\u00a0 But that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it.\u00a0 There are basic principles that are universal; there are certain truths which are self-evident -- and the United States of America will never waver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny.\u00a0Sixty-five years ago, a weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth and final inaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum up the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible suffering, the enormous sacrifice that had taken place.\u00a0 \"We have learned,\" he said, \"to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.\"The United Nations was built by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world -- from Africa and Asia, from Europe to the Americas.\u00a0 These architects of international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but na\u00efve -- it was rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war; rooted in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of splitting apart.Now it falls to us -- for this institution will be what we make of it.\u00a0 The United Nations does extraordinary good around the world -- feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, mending\u00a0 places that have been broken.\u00a0 But it also struggles to enforce its will, and to live up to the ideals of its founding.I believe that those imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution -- they are a calling to redouble our efforts.\u00a0 The United Nations can either be a place where we bicker about outdated grievances, or forge common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart, or what brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny, or a source of moral authority.\u00a0 In short, the United Nations can be an institution that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens, or it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the people we serve.\u00a0We have reached a pivotal moment.\u00a0 The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation -- one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations.\u00a0 And so, with confidence in our cause, and with a commitment to our values, we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people so richly deserve.Thank you very much, everybody.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-74.0059728, 40.7127753]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Fort Hood, TX", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Fort Hood Memorial Service Speech", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]To the Fort Hood community; to Admiral Mullen; General Casey; General Cone; Secretary McHugh; Secretary Gates; most importantly, to family, friends, and members of our Armed Forces: We come together filled with sorrow for the 13 Americans that we have lost, with gratitude for the lives that they led, and with a determination to honor them through the work we carry on.This is a time of war.\u00a0Yet these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle.\u00a0They were killed here, on American soil, in the heart of this great state and the heart of this great American community.\u00a0This is the fact that makes the tragedy even more painful, even more incomprehensible.For those families who have lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left.\u00a0We knew these men and women as soldiers and caregivers.\u00a0You knew them as mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers.But here is what you must also know:\u00a0Your loved ones endure through the life of our nation.\u00a0 Their memory will be honored in the places they lived and by the people they touched.\u00a0Their life's work is our security, and the freedom that we all too often take for granted.\u00a0Every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; every moment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is their legacy.Neither this country, nor the values upon which we were founded, could exist without men and women like these 13 Americans.

Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11.\u00a0Some had known intense combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those did.\u00a0Their lives speak to the strength, the dignity, the decency of those who serve, and that's how they will be remembered.For that same spirit is embodied in the community here at Fort Hood, and in the many wounded who are still recovering.\u00a0As was already mentioned, in those terrible minutes during the attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of their clothes. They braved gunfire to reach the wounded, and ferried them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck.One young soldier, Amber Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for some time that she, herself, had been shot in the back.\u00a0Two police officers -- Mark Todd and Kim Munley -- saved countless lives by risking their own.\u00a0One medic -- Francisco de la Serna -- treated both Officer Munley and the gunman who shot her.It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy.\u00a0But this much we do know: No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts. No just and loving God looks upon them with favor.\u00a0For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice -- in this world, and the next.These are trying times for our country.\u00a0In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists who killed nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and innocent Afghans and Pakistanis. In Iraq, we're working to bring a war to a successful end, as there are still those who would deny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for.As we face these challenges, the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that we are fighting for, and the strength that we must draw upon.\u00a0Theirs are the tales of American men and women answering an extraordinary call -- the call to serve their comrades, their communities, and their country.\u00a0In an age of self -- selfishness, they embody responsibility.\u00a0In an era of division, they call upon us to come together.\u00a0In a time of cynicism, they remind us of who we are as Americans.We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it.\u00a0We saw that valor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it in those who signed up knowing they would serve in harm\u0092s way.We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes.We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses.\u00a0And instead of claiming God for our side, we remember </p><p>Lincoln\u0092s words, and always pray to be on the side of God.We're a nation that is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal.\u00a0 We live that truth within our military, and see it in the varied backgrounds of those we lay to rest today.\u00a0We defend that truth at home and abroad, and we know that Americans will always be found on the side of liberty and equality.\u00a0That's who we are as a people.Tomorrow is Veterans Day.\u00a0It's a chance to pause, and to pay tribute -- for students to learn the struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of parents and grandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices that have been made in pursuit of a more perfect union.For history is filled with heroes.\u00a0You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marched across Europe; an uncle who fought in Vietnam; a sister who served in the Gulf.\u00a0But as we honor the many generations who have served, all of us -- every single American -- must acknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who've come before.1We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes.This generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen have volunteered in the time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known.\u00a0They have served tour after tour of duty in distant, different, and difficult places.\u00a0They have stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains.\u00a0They have extended the opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyranny and war.\u00a0They are men and women -- white, black, and brown -- of all faiths and all stations -- all Americans, serving together to protect our people, while giving others half a world away the chance to lead a better life.In today\u0092s wars, there's not always a simple ceremony that signals our troops\u0092 success -- no surrender papers to be signed, or capital to be claimed.\u00a0But the measure of the impact of these young men and women is no less great. In a world of threats that no know borders, their legacy will be marked in the safety of our cities and towns, and the security and opportunity that's extended abroad.\u00a0It will serve as testimony to the character of those who served, and the example that all of you in uniform set for America and for the world.Here at Fort Hood, we pay tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape the horror of war, even in the comfort of home.\u00a0Later today at Fort Lewis, one community will gather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan.Long after they are laid to rest -- when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured; when today\u0092s servicemen and women are veterans and their children have grown -- it will be said that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance -- not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burden to secure this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples.So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity.We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service.May God bless the memory of those that we have lost.And may God bless the United States of America.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-97.7797049, 31.13633149999999]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Shanghai Technology and Science Museum, Shanghai, China", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Town Hall Address in Shanghai", "article": "<p></p><p>Neih hou.

Good evening.To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and to my fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- the nature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that my Administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country. To address these important issues, it's important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. On September 11th, 2001, </p><p>19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers on board </p><p>one of these flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.As we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. Al Qaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- a ruthless, repressive, and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere.Just days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98 to 0. The </p><p>vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked </p><p>Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies, and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security.Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within a matter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the UN, a provisional government was established under President</p><p>Hamid Karzai. And an </p><p>International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.Then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in Iraq. The wrenching debate over the Iraq War is well-known and need not be repeated here. It's enough to say that for the next six years, the Iraq War drew the dominant share of our troops, our resources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world.Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to an responsible end. We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and women in uniform. Thanks to their courage, grit, and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.But while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda's leadership established a safe-haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient security forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory in Afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorism against the Pakistani people.Now throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. And that's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for more troops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe-havens in Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort.Since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed, and we've stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda world-wide. In Pakistan, that nation's Army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and although it was marred by fraud, that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan's laws and Constitution.Yet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards. There's no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. Our new Commander in Afghanistan,</p><p>General McChrystal, has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short, the status quo is not sustainable.As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you fought in Afghanistan. Some of you will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined and worthy of your service. And that's why, after the Afghan voting was completed, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Now let me be clear: There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010. So there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. Now given the stakes involved, I owed the American people, and our troops, no less.This review is now complete. And as Commander-in-Chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.I do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.And most of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I've visited our courageous wounded warriors at </p><p>Walter Reed. I've travelled to Dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place.1 I see firsthand the terrible wages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.So no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger, no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.Of course this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remains the same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.To meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must deny al Qaeda a safe-haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's security forces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future.We will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.The 30,000 additional troops that I'm announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest possible pace -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers. They'll increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.Because this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we're confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility; what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.Now taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue to advise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and more importantly, to the Afghan people -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.Second, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improved security.This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over. President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance. We'll support Afghan Ministries, governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas, such as agriculture, that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people.The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They've been confronted with occupation by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand: America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy, to strengthen those who build, to hasten the day when our troops will leave, and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.Third, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan.We're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. And that's why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.In the past, there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy.In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. And those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.These are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with Pakistan.I recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address a few of the prominent arguments that I have heard, and which I take very seriously.First, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that it cannot be stabilized, and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believe this argument depends upon a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. To abandon this area now, and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance, would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.Second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.Finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.As President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxury of committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the </p><p>words of President Eisenhower, who -- in discussing our national security -- said, \"Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.\"Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.All told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion dollars for the military this year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own.Now let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be an enduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.So as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict -- not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.And we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security, because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. And that's why I've made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them, because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-more destructive weapons. True security will come for those who reject them.We will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone. I've spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim World -- one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity.And finally, we must draw on the strength of our values. For the challenges that we face may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. And that's why we must promote our values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman, and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity, and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source, the moral source of America's authority.Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. But more than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, and markets open, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiers of human liberty. For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union was founded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will not claim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours. What we have fought for, and what we continue to fight for, is a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others [sic] peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.As a country, we're not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Roosevelt was President. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. And now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.In the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. It derives from our people: from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth.2This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But I also know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.It's easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. I believe -- I believe with every fiber of my being that we, as Americans, can still come together behind a common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment. They are a creed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.America, we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes.Thank you.

I mentioned this to Dave backstage.\u00a0 In the few weeks that I spent with my father as a child -- he came to visit me for about a month when I was young -- one of the things he did was to take me to my first jazz concert, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1971, and it was a Dave Brubeck concert.\u00a0 And I've been a jazz fan ever since.\u00a0 The world that he opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular.\u00a0And, Dave, for the joy that you've given millions of jazz lovers like me, for your six decades of revolutionary rhythms, you are rightly honored -- especially today, on your 89th birthday.He was born </p><p>Melvin Kaminsky --Mel Brooks:\u00a0 He never understood 4/4 time1 -- President Obama:\u00a0 He's still messing it up, Mel.\u00a0 Mel, I'm trying to say something nice about you, now.\u00a0 Please don't upstage me.As you can tell, he was born to entertain.\u00a0Or, as Mel Brooks explains it:\u00a0 \"Look at Jewish history -- unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable.\u00a0 So every 10 Jews, God designed one to be crazy and amuse the others.\"\u00a0According to Mel, \"By the time I was five I knew I was that one.\"\u00a0And by the time he was nine, this boy from Brooklyn had seen his first musical and dreamed of becoming \"the King of Broadway.\" But World War II meant service in the Army -- or, as he put it, \"the European Theater of Operations\" with \"lots of operations\" and \"very little theater.\"\u00a0 Returning home, he found success cranking out quips for </p><p>Sid Ceasar -- or as Mel described his reaction to success -- \"panic, hysteria, insomnia\u0085and years of psychoanalysis.\"That's right, we're reading back all your golden moments here, Mel.Unfortunately, many of the punch lines that have defined Mel Brooks' success cannot be repeated here.\u00a0 I was telling him that I went to see </p><p></p><p>Blazing Saddles -- when I was 10.\u00a0 And he pointed out that I think, according to the ratings, I should not have been allowed in the theater.\u00a0That's true.\u00a0 I think I had a fake ID.\u00a0But the statute of limitations has passed.Suffice it to say, in his satires and parodies, no cow is sacred, no genre is safe.\u00a0 He mocked the musical -- and Hitler -- in </p><p></p><p>The Producers, the western in Blazing Saddles, and the horror film in </p><p></p><p>Young Frankenstein.\u00a0But behind all the insanity and absurdity, there's been a method to Mel's madness.\u00a0 He's described his work as \"unearthing the truth that is all around us.\"\u00a0 And by illuminating uncomfortable truths -- about racism and sexism and anti-Semitism -- he's been called \"our jester, asking us to see ourselves as we really are, determined that we laugh ourselves sane.\"For this, he is one of the few people ever to receive an Emmy and a Grammy and an Oscar and a Tony.\u00a0 Writer, director, actor, producer, composer\u0085for his success -- and for his psychoanalysis -- we honor Mel Brooks.Reflecting on the challenge of finding one's voice, </p><p>Grace Bumbry once said:\u00a0 \"God has already planted that in your throat. It's your job to free it up, to allow that beautiful thing to shine through.\"\u00a0True to her name, Grace allowed her voice to shine through and touch all those within its range.\u00a0 Around her family's piano in St. Louis; on the talent show where, as a teenager, she moved the host to tears; and then, after being turned away from one music school because of the color of her skin -- her triumphant international debut at the Paris Opera, when she was just 23 years old.With a pitch and presence like no other, she became a global sensation, moving audiences at the great opera houses of the world.\u00a0 And performing here at the White House, it was said that she moved Jacqueline Kennedy to lean over and gently sing along the words to the President.Defying every expectation, Grace Bumbry then made the transition from mezzo to soprano.\u00a0 And over the decades that followed, she displayed a range like few others -- sometimes the middle ranges as a mezzo; sometimes the highs of a soprano; sometimes both in the same performance.\u00a0 Grace not only triumphed in different techniques, she transformed them.And though she gave her final operatic performance in 1997, she appears in recitals to this day.\u00a0 After nearly 50 years, she remains the definition of a diva in the classical sense:\u00a0 a divine voice worthy of the heavens.\u00a0 And tonight -- 32 years after she performed at the first Kennedy Center Honors for her mentor Marian Anderson -- we honor Grace Bumbry.Growing up in New York City's Little Italy, </p><p>Bobby De Niro always knew what he wanted to be.\u00a0 Coming home from the movies, he'd act out the parts.\u00a0 At age 10, in his school play, he made a rather unlikely debut in The Wizard of Oz as the Cowardly Lion.He has said:\u00a0 \"my joy as an actor is to live different lives.\"\u00a0 And in more than 60 films spanning more than 40 years, Robert De Niro has lived some of the most iconic and intense characters ever portrayed on film.\u00a0 A dying baseball player in </p><p>Bang The Drum Slowly.\u00a0 A young Vito Corleone in </p><p>The Godfather Part II.\u00a0 A deranged </p><p>Taxi Driver.\u00a0 A troubled veteran in </p><p>The Deer Hunter.\u00a0 A brutal boxer in </p><p>Raging Bull.\u00a0 A vengeful ex-con in </p><p>Cape Fear.\u00a0 Let's hope that Martin Scorsese was kidding when he said that Robert is \"full of something that he wanted to express.\"\u00a0 Don't worry, we did a vet on him before he came in tonight.But alongside his Oscar-winning emotional audacity there's his versatility, from a coma patient in </p><p>Awakenings, to an ever-possessive father in</p><p>Meet The Parents.\u00a0 There's his legendary method -- not simply portraying characters, but becoming them, emotionally and physically.\u00a0 And there is his love for his city\u00a0-- whether it's directing films like </p><p></p><p>A Bronx Tale, or founding the film center and festival that has energized the arts in New York City.It is perhaps the great irony of his life -- one of America's greatest cinematic actors is a man, famously, of few words off the screen -- and I can attest to this.\u00a0 So I'll simply say, thank you, Robert De Niro.Finally, we honor the quiet kid from Jersey -- who grew up to become the rock 'n' roll laureate of a generation. For in the life of our country only a handful of people have tapped the full power of music to tell the real American story -- with honesty; from the heart; and one of those people is </p><p>Bruce Springsteen.\u00a0He has said:\u00a0 \"I've always believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you, but to find out about themselves.\"\u00a0 And for more than three decades, in his songs -- of dreams and despair, of struggle and hope -- hardworking folks have seen themselves.They've seen their great state of New Jersey.\u00a0 And they've seen their America -- in songs that become anthems.\u00a0 Restless kids who were \"Born to Run.\" The struggles of workers in \"My Hometown.\"\u00a0 The sacrifices of vets who were \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Love and loss in \"Streets of Philadelphia.\"\u00a0 A resilient nation in \"The Rising.\"\u00a0 And, this year, a country \"Working on a Dream.\"It's no wonder that his tours are not so much concerts, but communions.\u00a0 There's a place for everybody -- the sense that no matter who you are or what you do, everyone deserves their shot at the American Dream; everybody deserves a little bit of dignity; everybody deserves to be heard.I've seen it myself.\u00a0 Bruce was a great fan -- a great friend over the last year, and when I watched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he rocked the National Mall before my inauguration, I thought it captured as well as anything the spirit of what America should be about.\u00a0 On a day like that, and today, I remember:\u00a0 I'm the President, but he's The Boss.\u00a0 And Bruce continues to inspire, along with his \"house-rocking, earth-shaking\" E Street Band.\u00a0 At 60 years old, he's still filling stadiums, still whipping fans into a frenzy, still surfing the crowd, still jumping off pianos, and still reaching new fans, and still being nominated for Grammys.\u00a0 It's been a long road from that stage at </p><p></p><p>Stone Pony in Asbury Park to this stage today, but this much we know -- after more than 30 years and 120 million albums sold, Bruce Springsteen is still one \"cool rockin' Daddy.\"Dave Brubeck.\u00a0 Mel Brooks.\u00a0 Grace Bumbry.\u00a0 Robert De Niro.\u00a0 Bruce Springsteen.\u00a0 Their stories are their own.\u00a0 But the part that they play in the larger American story -- that's what we honor here tonight.\u00a0 What they say is that with respect for the past, we can keep strong the traditions and values that enrich us all; that with confidence in the present, and in ourselves, we can overcome whatever comes our way; and that with faith in the future, America's greatest \"Glory Days\" are still to come.So thank you to all of our honorees.\u00a0 Thank you all very much for the joy and the beauty that you've contributed to our lives.\u00a0 We are very grateful.\u00a0 Thank you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Washington, D.C.", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Brookings Institution Speech on Job Creation", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Thank you so much, Strobe, for your extraordinary leadership here at Brookings, and thanks to all of you in attendance.\u00a0Almost exactly one year ago, on a frigid winter's day, I met with my new economic team at the headquarters of my presidential transition offices in Chicago.\u00a0 And over the course of four hours, my advisors presented an analysis of where the economy at that time stood, accompanied by a chilling set of charts and graphs, predicting where we might end up.\u00a0 It was an unforgettable series of presentations.Christy Romer -- who's here today -- tapped to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as Larry Summers, who I'd chosen to head the National Economic Council, described an imminent downturn comparable in its severity to almost nothing since the 1930s.\u00a0 Tim Geithner, my incoming Treasury Secretary, reported that the financial system, shaken by the subprime crisis, had halted almost all lending, which in turn threatened to pull the broader economy in a downward spiral.\u00a0 Peter Orszag, my incoming Budget Director, closed out the proceedings with an entirely dismal report on the fiscal health of the country, with growing deficits and debt stretching to the horizon.\u00a0 Having concluded that it was too late for me to request a recount -- I tasked my team with mapping out a plan to tackle the crisis on all fronts.\u00a0It wasn't long after that meeting, as we shaped this economic plan, that we began to see some of these forecasts materialize.\u00a0 Over the previous year, it was obvious that folks were facing hard times.\u00a0 As I traveled across the country during the long campaign, I would meet men and women bearing the brunt of not only a deepening recession, but also years -- even decades -- of growing strains on middle class families.\u00a0 But now the country was experiencing something far worse.\u00a0 Our gross domestic product -- the sum total of all that our economy produces\u00a0 -- fell at the fastest rate in a quarter century.\u00a0 Five trillion dollars of Americans' household wealth evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, pensions, and home values plummeted.\u00a0 We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month, equivalent to the population of the state of Vermont.\u00a0 That was true in December, January, February, March.\u00a0 The fear among economists across the political spectrum that was -- was that we were rapidly plummeting towards a second Great Depression.So, in the weeks and months that followed, we undertook a series of difficult steps to prevent that outcome.\u00a0 And we were forced to take those steps largely without the help of an opposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided over the decision-making that had led to the crisis, decided to hand it over to others to solve.We acted to get lending flowing again so businesses could get loans to buy equipment, and ordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes and cars, to go to college, and to start or run businesses.\u00a0 We enacted measures to stem the tide of foreclosures in our housing market, helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broader decline in home values which was eating away at what tends to be a family's largest asset.\u00a0To achieve this, and to prevent economic collapse, we were forced to extend assistance to some of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate the turmoil.\u00a0 We also took steps to prevent the rapid dissolution of the American auto industry -- which faced a crisis partly of its own making -- to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs during an already fragile, shaky time.\u00a0 These were not decisions that were popular or satisfying; these were decisions that were necessary.Now, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking sector, in our housing market, and in our auto industry, we also began attacking our economic crisis on a broader front.\u00a0 Less than one month after taking office we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery package in history:\u00a0 the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\u00a0The Recovery Act was divided into three parts.\u00a0 One-third went for tax relief for small businesses and 95 percent of working families.\u00a0 Another third was for emergency relief to help folks who've borne the brunt of this recession.\u00a0 We extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 17 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families relying on COBRA. And for state and local governments facing historic budget shortfalls as demand for services went up and revenues went down, we provided assistance that has saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and public school workers, firefighters and police officers.The last third of the Recovery Act is for investments to put Americans to work doing the work that America needs done:\u00a0 doubling our capacity in renewable energy like wind and solar; computerizing medical records to save money and lives; providing the largest boost to medical research in history; renovating classrooms and school laboratories; and upgrading roads and railways as part of the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of the Interstate Highway System half a century ago.And even as the Recovery Act has created jobs and spurred growth, we have not let up in our efforts to take every responsible action to get the economy growing and America working.\u00a0This fall, I signed into law more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses, extended an effective tax credit for homebuyers, and provided additional unemployment insurance for one million Americans.\u00a0 And the Treasury is continuing to adapt our financial stability plan, helping to facilitate the flow of small credit to small businesses and families.\u00a0 In addition, we're working to break down barriers and open overseas markets so our companies can better compete globally, creating jobs in America by exporting our products around the world.Now, partly as a result of these and other steps, we are in a very different place today than we were one year ago.\u00a0 We may forget, but we're in a very different place.\u00a0 We can safely say that we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we've avoided the depression many feared.\u00a0 Our economy is growing for the first time in a year, and the swing from contraction to expansion since the beginning of the year is the largest in nearly three decades.\u00a0Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were.\u00a0 In fact we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month.\u00a0 This is welcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that the Recovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office.But I'm here today because our work is far from done.\u00a0 For even though we've reduced the deluge of job losses to a relative trickle, we are not yet creating jobs at a pace to help all those families who've been swept up in the flood.\u00a0 There are more than 7 million fewer Americans with jobs today than when this recession began.\u00a0 That's a staggering figure, and one that reflects not only the depths of the hole from which we must ascend, but also a continuing human tragedy.\u00a0It was mentioned that I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a job center where people were engaged in job search.\u00a0 And it ran the spectrum -- blacks, whites, Hispanics, young people who were just starting their careers, individuals 50, 60 years old, looking for a job.\u00a0 And they were putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually things would work out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps this time it was different.\u00a0 Sometimes it's hard to break out of the bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves that behind these statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their families.\u00a0 It speaks to an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the short term while laying a new foundation for lasting economic growth.My economic team has been considering a full range of additional ideas to help accelerate the pace of private sector hiring.\u00a0 We held a jobs forum at the White House that brought together small business owners, CEOs, union members, economists, folks from non-profits, and state and local officials to talk about job creation.\u00a0 And I've asked people to lead forums in their own communities -- sending the results to me -- so we are hearing as many voices as possible as we refine our proposals.\u00a0 We've already heard a number of good ideas, and I know we'll learn of many more.So today, I want to outline some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart of our effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the greatest number of jobs while generating the greatest value for our economy.First, we're proposing a series of steps to help small businesses grow and hire new staff.\u00a0 Over the past 15 years, small businesses have created roughly 65 percent of all new jobs in America.\u00a0 These are companies formed around kitchen tables in family meetings, formed when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, formed when a worker decides it's time she became her own boss.\u00a0 These are also companies that drive innovation, producing 13 times more patents per employee than large companies.\u00a0 And it's worth remembering, every once in a while a small business becomes a big business -- and changes the world.That's why it's so important that we help small business struggling to stay open, or struggling to open in the first place, during these difficult times.\u00a0 Building on the tax cuts in the Recovery Act, we're proposing a complete elimination of capital gains taxes on small business investment along with an extension of write-offs to encourage small businesses to expand in the coming year.\u00a0 And I believe it's worthwhile to create a tax incentive to encourage small businesses to add and keep employees, and I'm going to work with Congress to pass one.Now, these steps will help, but we also have to address the continuing struggle of small businesses to get loans that they need to start up and grow.\u00a0 To that end, we're proposing to waive fees and increase the guarantees for SBA-backed loans.\u00a0 And I'm asking my Treasury Secretary to continue mobilizing the remaining TARP funds to facilitate lending to small businesses.Second, we're proposing a boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what was included in the Recovery Act, to continue modernizing our transportation and communications networks.\u00a0 These are needed public works that engage private sector companies, spurring hiring all across the country.\u00a0Already, more than 10,000 of these projects have been funded through the Recovery Act.\u00a0 And by design, Recovery Act work on roads, bridges, water systems, Superfund sites, broadband networks, and clean energy projects will all be ramping up in the months ahead.\u00a0 It was planned this way for two reasons:\u00a0 so the impact would be felt over a two-year period; and, more importantly, because we wanted to do this right.\u00a0The potential for abuse in a program of this magnitude, while operating at such a fast pace, was enormous.\u00a0 So I asked Vice President Biden and others to make sure to the extent humanly possible that the investments were sound, the projects worthy, and the execution efficient.\u00a0 What this means is that we're going to see even more work -- and workers -- on recovery projects in the next six months than we saw in the last six months.Even so, there are many more worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them.\u00a0 I recognize that by their nature these projects often take time, and will therefore create jobs over time.\u00a0 But the need for jobs will also last beyond next year and the benefits of these investments will last years beyond that.\u00a0 So adding to this initiative to rebuild America's infrastructure is the right thing to do.\u00a0Third, I'm calling on Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumers who retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know creates jobs, saves money for families, and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment.\u00a0 And I'm proposing that we expand select Recovery Act initiatives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy jobs which have been proven to be particularly popular and effective.\u00a0It's a positive sign that many of these programs drew so many applicants for funding that a lot of strong proposals -- proposals that will leverage private capital and create jobs quickly -- did not make the cut.\u00a0 With additional resources, in areas like advanced manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels, for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good private sector jobs.Finally, as we are moving forward in these areas, we should also extend the relief in the Recovery Act, including emergency assistance to seniors, unemployment insurance benefits, COBRA, and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs.\u00a0 This will help folks weathering these storms, while boosting consumer spending and promoting job growth.Of course, there's only so much government can do. Job creation will ultimately depend on the real job creators:\u00a0 businesses across America.\u00a0 We were encouraged today to hear from the Business Roundtable that their survey showed greater confidence and greater potential investment coming out of the business community.\u00a0Government can help lay the groundwork on which the private sector can better generate jobs, growth, and innovation.\u00a0 After all, small business tax relief is not a substitute for ingenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but it can help those with good ideas to grow and expand.\u00a0 Incentives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy manufacturing don't automatically create jobs or lower carbon emissions -- but these steps provide a framework in which companies can compete and innovate to create those jobs and reduce energy consumption.\u00a0 And while modernizing the physical and virtual networks that connect us will create private-sector jobs, they'll do so while making it possible for companies to more easily and effectively move their products across this country and around the world, and that will create more jobs.And given the challenges of accelerating the pace of hiring in the private sector, these targeted initiatives are right and they are needed.\u00a0 But with a fiscal crisis to match our economic crisis, we also must be prudent about how we fund it.\u00a0 So to help support these efforts, we are going to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- or TARP -- the fund created to stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again.I don't think I have to tell you there has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP, which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may have been -- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system.\u00a0 Launched hastily -- understandably, but hastily -- under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed, and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly.\u00a0 And today, TARP has served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected.In fact, because of our stewardship of this program, and the transparency and accountability we put in place, TARP is expected to cost the taxpayers at least $200 billion less than what was anticipated just this past summer.\u00a0 And the assistance to banks, once thought to cost taxpayers untold billions, is on track to actually reap billions in profits for the taxpaying public.\u00a0 So this gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought possible and to shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs on Main Street.Small business, infrastructure, clean energy -- these are areas in which we can put Americans to work while putting our nation on a sturdier economic footing.\u00a0 That foundation for sustained economic growth -- that must be our continuing focus and our ultimate goal.\u00a0I've said this before.\u00a0 Even before this particular crisis, much of our growth for a decade or more had been fueled by unsustainable consumer debt and reckless financial speculation, while we ignored the fundamental challenges that hold the key to our economic prosperity.\u00a0 We cannot simply go back to the way things used to be.\u00a0 We can't go back to an economy that yielded cycle after cycle of speculative booms and painful busts.\u00a0 We can't continue to accept an education system in which our students trail their peers in other countries, and a health care system in which exploding costs put our businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\u00a0 And we cannot continue to ignore the clean energy challenge or cede global leadership in the emerging industries of the 21st century.\u00a0 And that's why, even as we strive to meet the crisis of the moment, we have insisted on laying a new foundation for the future.Because an educated workforce is essential to a 21st century global economy, we've launched a competitive Race to the Top fund through the Recovery Act to reform our schools and raise achievement, especially in math and science.\u00a0 And we've made college more affordable, proposed a historic set of reforms and investments in community college, and set a goal of once again leading the world in producing college graduates by the year 2020.Because even the best-trained worker in the world can't compete if our businesses are saddled with rapidly increasing health care costs, we are fighting to do what we have discussed in this country for generations -- finally reforming our nation's broken health insurance system and relieving this unsustainable burden.Because our economic future depends on a financial system that encourages sound investments, honest dealings, and long-term growth, we've proposed the most ambitious financial reforms since the Great Depression.\u00a0 We'll set and enforce clear rules of the road, close loopholes in oversight, charge a new agency with protecting consumers and address the dangerous, systemic risks that brought us to the brink of disaster.\u00a0 These reforms are moving through Congress, we're working to keep those reforms strong, and I'm looking forward to signing them into law.And because our economic future depends on our leadership in the industries of the future, we are investing in basic applied research, and working to create the incentives to build a new clean energy economy.\u00a0 For we know the nation that leads in clean energy will be the nation that leads the world.\u00a0 I want America to be that nation.\u00a0 I want America's prosperity to be powered by what we invent and pioneer -- not just what we borrow and what we consume.\u00a0 And I know that we can and will be that nation if we are willing to do what it takes to get there.Now, there are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on the one hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other.\u00a0 This is a false choice.\u00a0 Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical to ensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things like unemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down.\u00a0 At the same time, instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector the confidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America.So one of the central goals of this administration is restoring fiscal responsibility.\u00a0 Even as we have had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term, we've begun to make the hard choices necessary to get our country on a more stable fiscal footing in the long run.\u00a0 So let me just be clear here.\u00a0 Despite what some have claimed, the cost of the Recovery Act is only a very small part of our current budget imbalance.\u00a0 In reality, the deficit had been building dramatically over the previous eight years.\u00a0 We have a structural gap between the money going out and the money coming in.\u00a0Folks passed tax cuts and expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- even as health care costs kept rising, year after year.\u00a0 As a result, the deficit had reached $1.3 trillion when we walked into the White House.\u00a0 And I'd note:\u00a0 These budget-busting tax cuts and spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxing political about fiscal responsibility, while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by getting health care costs under control.\u00a0 It's a sight to see.The fact is we have refused to go along with business as usual; we are taking responsibility for every dollar we spend.\u00a0 We've done what some said was impossible:\u00a0 preventing wasteful spending on outdated weapons systems that even the Pentagon said it didn't want.\u00a0 We've combed the budget, cutting waste and excess wherever we could.\u00a0 I'm still committed to halving the deficit we inherited by the end of my first term -- cutting it in half.\u00a0 And I made clear from day one that I would not sign a health insurance reform bill if it raised the deficit by one dime -- and neither the House, nor the Senate bill does.\u00a0 We've begun not only changing policies in Washington, we've also begun to change the culture in Washington.In the end, the economic crisis of the past year was not just the result of weaknesses in our economy.\u00a0 It was also the result of weaknesses in our political system, because for decades, too many in Washington put off the hard decisions.\u00a0 For decades, we've watched as efforts to solve tough problems have fallen prey to the bitterness of partisanship, to prosaic concerns of politics, to ever-quickening news cycles, to endless campaigns focused on scoring points instead of meeting our common challenges.We've seen the consequences of this failure of responsibility.\u00a0 The American people have paid a heavy price.\u00a0 And the question we'll have to answer now is if we're going to learn from our past, or if -- even in the aftermath of disaster -- we're going to repeat those same mistakes.\u00a0 As the alarm bells fade, the din of Washington rises, as the forces of the status quo marshal their resources, we can be sure that answering this question will be a fight to the finish.\u00a0 But I have every hope and expectation that we can rise to this moment, that we can transcend the failures of the past, that we can once again take responsibility for our future.Every night I read letters and e-mails sent to me from people across America -- ordinary folks, people who share their hopes and their hardships, their faith in this country, their frustration with what's happened in this economy.\u00a0 I hear from small business owners worried about making payroll, keeping their doors open.\u00a0 I hear from mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, who've seen one or two or more family members out of work.\u00a0 The toughest letters are in children's handwriting -- kids write to me, my dad just lost a job; my grandma is sick, she can't afford health insurance -- kids who can't just be kids because they're worried about mom having her hours cut or dad losing a job, or a family without health insurance.\u00a0These folks aren't looking for a handout, they're not looking for a bailout -- just like those people I visited in Allentown -- all they're looking for is a chance to make their own way, to work, to succeed using their talents and skills.\u00a0 And they're looking for folks in Washington to have a seriousness of purpose that matches the reality of their struggle.Everywhere I've gone, every stop I've made, there are people like this, men and women who have faced misfortune, but who stand ready to build a better future:\u00a0 students ready to learn, workers eager to work, scientists on the brink of discovery, entrepreneurs seeking the chance to open a small business.\u00a0 Everywhere I go, there are once-shuttered factories just waiting to whir back to life in burgeoning industries.\u00a0 There is a nation ready to meet the challenges of this new age and to lead the world in this new century.\u00a0 And as we look back on the progress of the past year, and look forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that we will do exactly that.These have been a tough two years.\u00a0 And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead.\u00a0 But the storms of the past are receding.\u00a0 The skies are brightening.\u00a0 And the horizon is beckoning once more.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.0368707,

"article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of America, and citizens of the world:\u00a0I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility. It's an award that speaks to our highest aspirations -- that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world, we are not mere prisoners of fate. Our actions matter, and can bend history in the direction of justice.\u00a0And yet, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated.\u00a0In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize -- Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight. And then there are the men and women around the world who've been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics. I cannot argue with those who find these men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I.\u00a0But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\u00a0One of these wars is winding down.\u00a0The other is a conflict that America did not seek, one in which we are joined by 42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.\u00a0Still, we are at war. And I am responsible1 for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land.\u00a0Some will kill; and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.Now these questions are not new.\u00a0War, in one form or another, appeared with the first man.\u00a0At the dawn of history, its morality was not questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease -- the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences.And over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war. The concept of a \"just war\" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.\u00a0Of course, we know that for most of history, this concept of \"just war\" was rarely observed.\u00a0The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God.\u00a0Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred.\u00a0In the span of 30 years, such carnage would twice engulf this continent.\u00a0And while it's hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers, World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished.\u00a0In the wake of such destruction, and with the advent of the nuclear age, it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war.\u00a0And so a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the </p><p>League of Nations -- an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace:\u00a0a Marshall Plan, and a United Nations; mechanisms to govern the waging of war, treaties to protect human rights, prevent genocide, restrict the most dangerous weapons.\u00a0In many ways, these efforts succeeded.\u00a0Yes, terrible wars have been fought, and atrocities committed.\u00a0But there has been no Third World War.\u00a0The Cold War ended with </p><p>jubilant crowds dismantling a wall.\u00a0Commerce has stitched much of the world together.\u00a0Billions have been lifted from poverty.\u00a0The ideals of liberty and self-determination, equality, and the rule of law have haltingly advanced.\u00a0We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past, and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud.And yet, a decade into a new century, this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats. The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers, but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe.\u00a0Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.\u00a0Moreover, wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations.\u00a0The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts; the growth of secessionist movements, insurgencies, and failed states -- all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos.\u00a0In today's wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.\u00a0I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war.\u00a0What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago.\u00a0And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of \"just war\" and the imperatives of a just peace.\u00a0We must begin by acknowledging a hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations, acting individually or in concert, will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.\u00a0I make this statement mindful of whatMartin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago:\u00a0\"Violence never brings permanent peace.\u00a0It solves no social problem. It merely creates new and more complicated ones.\"\u00a0As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence.\u00a0I know there's nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing na\u00efve in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.\u00a0But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone.\u00a0I face the world as it is and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake:\u00a0Evil does exist in the world.\u00a0A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies.\u00a0Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.\u00a0To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism. It is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason.\u00a0I raise this point, I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today -- no matter what the cause.\u00a0And at times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America, the world's sole military superpower.Yet, the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world.\u00a0Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.\u00a0 The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will.\u00a0We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.\u00a0So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace.\u00a0And yet this truth must coexist with another: that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy.\u00a0The soldier's courage and sacrifice is full of glory -- expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms. But war itself is never glorious; and we must never trumpet it as such.\u00a0So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths: that war is sometimes necessary; and war at some level is an expression of human folly.\u00a0Concretely, we must direct our effort to the task thatPresident Kennedy called for long ago.\u00a0\"Let us focus,\" he said, \"on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions.\"\u00a0A gradual evolution of human institutions.What might this evolution look like?What might these practical steps be?To begin with, I believe that all nations, strong and weak alike, must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.\u00a0I, like any head of state, reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do and isolates and weakens those who don't.The world rallied around America after the </p><p>9/11 attacks and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense.\u00a0Likewise, the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.\u00a0Furthermore, America -- in fact, no nation -- can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves.\u00a0For when we don't, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor.\u00a0More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.\u00a0I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.\u00a0Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later.\u00a0That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.\u00a0America's commitment to global security will never waver. But in a world in which threats are more diffuse and missions more complex America cannot act alone.\u00a0America alone cannot secure the peace.\u00a0This is true in Afghanistan.\u00a0This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering. And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they've shown in Afghanistan.\u00a0But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public.\u00a0I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this:\u00a0The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it.Peace requires responsibility.Peace entails sacrifice.That's why NATO continues to be indispensable.\u00a0That's why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries.\u00a0That's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome, to Ottawa and Sydney, to Dhaka and Kigali. We honor them not as makers of war, but as -- of wagers -- but as wagers of peace.</p><p>\u00a0Let me make one final point about the use of force.\u00a0Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it.\u00a0The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to </p><p>Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct. And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different from those whom we fight.\u00a0That is a source of our strength.\u00a0That is why I prohibited torture.\u00a0That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend.\u00a0And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it's easy, but when it is hard.I've spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war.\u00a0But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace.First, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior. For if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something.\u00a0Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable.\u00a0Sanctions must exact a real price.\u00a0 Intransigence must be met with increased pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.\u00a0One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them.\u00a0In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear:\u00a0All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament.\u00a0I am committed to upholding this treaty.\u00a0It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy. And I'm working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia's nuclear stockpiles.\u00a0But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.\u00a0Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted.\u00a0Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia.\u00a0Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people. When there is </p><p>genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma -- there must be consequences.\u00a0Yes, there will be engagement. Yes, there will be diplomacy. But there must be consequences when those things fail. And the closer we stand together, the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression.\u00a0This brings me to a second point: the nature of the peace that we seek. For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict.\u00a0Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting.It was this insight that drove drafters of the</p><p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War.\u00a0In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.And yet, too often these words are ignored.\u00a0For some countries, the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation's development.\u00a0And within America, there's long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.\u00a0I reject these choices.\u00a0I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear.\u00a0 Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence.\u00a0We also know that the opposite is true.\u00a0Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace.\u00a0America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens.\u00a0No matter how callously defined, neither America's interests -- nor the world's -- are served by the denial of human aspirations.So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal.\u00a0We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like</p><p>Aung Sang Suu Kyi, to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings, to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran.\u00a0It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation. And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side.\u00a0Let me also say this:\u00a0The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone. At times, it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy.\u00a0I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation.\u00a0But I also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo.\u00a0No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.\u00a0In light of the </p><p>Cultural Revolution's horrors, Nixon's meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies.\u00a0Pope John Paul's engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders like </p><p>Lech Walesa.\u00a0Ronald Reagan's efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe.\u00a0There's no simple formula here.\u00a0 But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.\u00a0Third, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must encompass economic security and opportunity.\u00a0Fortrue -- true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want.It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine and shelter they need to survive.\u00a0It does not exist where children can't aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family.\u00a0The absence of hope can rot a society from within.\u00a0And that's why helping farmers feed their own people, or nations educate their children and care for the sick, is not mere charity.\u00a0It's also why the world must come together to confront climate change.\u00a0There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing, we will face more drought, more famine, more mass displacement -- all of which will fuel more conflict for decades.\u00a0For this reason, it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action. It's military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance.\u00a0Agreements among nations. Strong institutions.\u00a0Support for human rights.\u00a0Investments in development. All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about. And yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more; and that's the continued expansion of our moral imagination -- an insistence that there's something irreducible that we all share.\u00a0As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are -- to understand that we're all basically seeking the same things, that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families.\u00a0And yet, somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities -- their -- their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion.\u00a0In some places, this fear has led to conflict.\u00a0At times, it even feels like we're moving backwards. We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden.\u00a0We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines.And most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from Afghanistan.\u00a0These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God. The cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded.\u00a0But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war.\u00a0For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for restraint -- no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the Red Cross worker, or even a person of one own's [sic] faith.Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace, but I believe it's incompatible with the very purpose of faith: For the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature.\u00a0For we are fallible. We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of pride, and power, and sometimes evil. Even those of us with the best of intentions will at time[s] fail to right the wrongs before us.But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected.\u00a0We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place.\u00a0The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached -- their fundamental faith in human progress -- that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.\u00a0For if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or na\u00efve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- then we lose what's best about humanity.\u00a0We lose our sense of possibility.\u00a0We lose our moral compass.\u00a0Like generations have before us, we must reject that future.\u00a0AsDr. King said at this occasion so many years ago, \"I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history.\u00a0I refuse to accept the idea that the 'isness' of man's present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal 'oughtness' that forever confronts him.\"Let us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine that still st[i]rs within each of our souls.Somewhere today, in the here and now, in the world as it is, a soldier sees he's outgunned, but stands firm to keep the peace.\u00a0Somewhere today, in this world, a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to march on.\u00a0Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child, scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school -- because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child's dreams.Let us live by their example. We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice.\u00a0We can admit the intractability of depravation, and still strive for dignity.\u00a0Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace.\u00a0We can do that -- for that is the story of human progress; that's the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10.7337252, 59.9121487]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "UN Copenhagen Climate Change Conference Speech", "article": "<p></p><p></p><p>Audio mp3 of AddressGood morning. It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger to our people. All of you would not be here unless you -- like me -- were convinced that this danger is real. This is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This much we know.The question, then, before us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is our capacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I have to be honest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now, and it hangs in the balance.I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I come here today -- not to talk, but to act.Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bears our responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility. That's why we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations. That's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That's why we've taken bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewable energy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings; and by pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy.These mitigation actions are ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future -- that it will create millions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation. We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a more efficient fashion, is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change.So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course of action to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy, no matter what happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good for us, as well as good for the world. But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we act together. That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree to certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings, bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear.First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased that many of us have already done so. Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets, significant targets, ambitious targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020, and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation.Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, and exchange this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be intrusive, or infringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and that we're living up to our obligations. Without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on a page.I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. It would be a hollow victory.Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly the least developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will be a part of fast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012. And yesterday, Secretary Hillary Clinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $100 billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a broader accord that I have just described.Mitigation. Transparency. Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to a significant accord -- one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community.I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point, the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we prefer posturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I just described. No country will get everything that it wants. There are those developing countries that want aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to transparency. They think that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand that. There are those advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance, or that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's fastest-growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years. These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and we have very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate change phenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line: We can embrace this accord, take a substantial step forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can do that, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor -- one that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren.Or we can choose delay, falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month, year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible.Ladies and gentlemen, there is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We have charted our course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a common purpose.We are ready to get this done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides to recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk; it\u0092s better for us to choose action over inaction; the future over the past -- and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meet our responsibility to our people, and the future of our planet.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [12.5683372, 55.6760968]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "Kailua, Hawaii", "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "On NW Flight 253 Terrorist Threat and Iran Violence", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take just a few minutes to update the American people on the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day and the steps we're taking to ensure the safety and security of the country.The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, and my counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, John Brennan. I asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation to keep the American people and members of Congress informed.Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, </p><p>Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its final approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried to ignite an explosive device on his body, setting off a fire. Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, the suspect was immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. </p><p>The suspect is now in custody and has been </p><p>charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. And a full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable.Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those who threaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing down that plane, it could have killed nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidays with their families and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doing everything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holiday season. Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following actions to be taken to protect the American people and to secure air travel. First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the traveling public. We made sure that all flights still in the air were secure and could land safely. We immediately enhanced screening and security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. We added federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And we're working closely in this country, federal, state and local law enforcement, with our international partners.Second, I've ordered two important reviews1,2, because it's absolutely critical that we learn from this incident and take the necessary measures to prevent future acts of terrorism.The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has had in place for many years to identify known and suspected terrorists so that we can prevent their entry into the United States. Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, but not on a watch list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough review, not only of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch list system and how it can be strengthened.The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related to air travel. We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks.Third, I've directed my national security team to keep up the pressure on those who would attack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but those who would slaughter innocent men, women, and children must know that the United States will more -- do more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland.Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plotting against us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the values that we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist.As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As Americans, we will never give in to fear or division. We will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeply held values.That's who we are as Americans.That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend the holidays in harm's way.And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the new year and beyond.Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken place over the last few days in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States joins with the international community in strongly condemning the violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, which has apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death.For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days. And each time that has happened, the world has watched with deep admiration for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people who are part of Iran's great and enduring civilization.What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other country. It's about the Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves. And the decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making those aspirations go away.</p><p>As I said in Oslo, it's telling when governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people more than the power of any other nation.Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek their universal rights. We call upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that it has to respect the rights of its own people.We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained within Iran.We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are taking place there. And I'm confident that history will be on the side of those who seek justice.Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-157.7394444, 21.4022222]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": "White House,

from audio]I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, including those from our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies involved in the security reviews that I ordered after the failed attack on Christmas Day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I called these leaders to the White House because we face a challenge of the utmost urgency.\u00a0As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in their efforts to kill Americans.\u00a0 And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, but to disrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all.Indeed, over the past year, we've taken the fight to al Qaeda and its allies wherever they plot and train, be it in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countries around the world.Here at home, our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have worked together with considerable success:\u00a0gathering intelligence, stitching it together, and making arrests -- from Denver to Texas, from Illinois to New York -- disrupting plots and saving American lives.\u00a0 And these successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week in the </p><p>loss of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan.\u00a0 But when a </p><p>suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day the system has failed in a potentially disastrous way.\u00a0 And it's my responsibility to find out why, and to correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future.And that's why, shortly after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews.\u00a0 I directed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review aviation screening, technology and procedures.\u00a0 She briefed me on her initial findings today, and I'm pleased that this review is drawing on the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and his department.I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security advisor John Brennan to lead a </p><p>thorough review into our terrorist watch-listing system so we can fix what went wrong.\u00a0 As we discussed today, this ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemic failures that almost cost nearly 300 lives.\u00a0 We will make a summary of this preliminary report public within the next few days, but let me share some of what we know so far.As I described over the weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that </p><p>Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists there.\u00a0 It now turns out that our intelligence community knew of other red flags -- that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen, but the United States itself.\u00a0 And we had information that this group was working with an individual who was known -- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the Christmas attack.The bottom line is this:\u00a0 The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack.\u00a0 But our intelligence community failed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the \"no fly\" list.In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had.\u00a0 The information was there.\u00a0 Agencies and analysts who needed it had access to it.\u00a0 And our professionals were trained to look for it and to bring it all together.Now, I will accept that intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged.\u00a0 That's not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it.\u00a0 Time and again, we've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary.So we have to do better -- and we will do better.\u00a0 And we have to do it quickly.\u00a0 American lives are on the line.\u00a0 So I made it clear today to my team:\u00a0 I want our initial reviews completed this week.\u00a0 I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong.\u00a0 I want those reforms implemented immediately, so that this doesn't happen again and so we can prevent future attacks.\u00a0 And I know that every member of my team that I met with today understands the urgency of getting this right.\u00a0 And I appreciate that each of them took responsibility for the shortfalls within their own agencies.Immediately after the attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people:\u00a0 new screening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more explosive detection teams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and deepening cooperation with international partners.In recent days, we've taken additional steps to improve security.\u00a0 Counterterrorism officials have reviewed and updated our terrorist watch list system, including adding more individuals to the </p><p>\"no fly\" list.\u00a0 And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is not broken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the \"no fly\" list shows that this system needs to be strengthened.The State Department is now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visa information in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist connections.\u00a0 As of yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhanced screening for passengers flying into the United States from, or flying through, nations on our list of state sponsors of terrorism, or other countries of interest.\u00a0 And in the days ahead, I will announce further steps to disrupt attacks, including better integration of information and enhanced passenger screening for air travel.Finally, some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit the decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\u00a0 So let me be clear.\u00a0 It was always our intent to transfer detainees to other countries only under conditions that provide assurances that our security is being protected.With respect to Yemen in particular, there's an ongoing security situation which we have been confronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner.\u00a0 Given the unsettled situation, I've spoken to the Attorney General and we've agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to Yemen at this time.But make no mistake:\u00a0 We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda.\u00a0 In fact, that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\u00a0 And, as I've always said, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safe and secure.Our reviews -- and the steps that we've taken and will continue to take -- go to the heart of the kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century.\u00a0 Just as al Qaeda and its allies are constantly evolving and adapting their efforts to strike us, we have to constantly adapt and evolve to defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin for error is slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic.As these violent extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever they take root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are doing currently with the government in Yemen.\u00a0 As our adversaries seek new recruits, we'll constantly review and rapidly update our intelligence and our institutions.\u00a0 As they refine our tactics, we'll enhance our defenses, including smarter screening and security at airports, and investing in the technologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas.\u00a0 In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems -- and the people in them -- to be accountable and to work as intended:\u00a0 collecting, sharing, integrating, analyzing, and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocent lives -- not just most of the time, but all the time.\u00a0 That's what the American people deserve.As President, that's exactly what I will demand.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry":

and Aviation Security", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 The immediate reviews1,2 that I ordered after the failed Christmas terrorist attack are now complete.\u00a0 I was just briefed on the findings and recommendations for reform, and I believe it's important that the American people understand the new steps that we're taking to prevent attacks and keep our country safe.\u00a0This afternoon, my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor, John Brennan, </p><p>will discuss his review into our terrorist watchlist system -- how our government failed to connect the dots in a way that would have prevented a </p><p>known terrorist from boarding a plane for America, and the steps we're going to take to prevent that from happening again.Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will discuss her review of aviation screening, technology and procedures -- how that terrorist boarded a plane with explosives that could have killed nearly 300 innocent people, and how we'll strengthen aviation security going forward.So today I want to just briefly summarize their conclusions and the steps that I've ordered to address them.In our ever-changing world, America's first line of defense is timely, accurate intelligence that is shared, integrated, analyzed, and acted upon quickly and effectively.\u00a0 That's what the intelligence reforms after the 9/11 attacks largely achieved. That's what our intelligence community does every day.\u00a0 But, unfortunately, that's not what happened in the lead-up to Christmas Day.\u00a0 It's now clear that shortcomings occurred in three broad and compounding ways.\u00a0First, although our intelligence community had learned a great deal about the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen -- called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- that we knew that they sought to strike the United States and that they were recruiting operatives to do so -- the intelligence community did not aggressively follow up on and prioritize particular streams of intelligence related to a possible attack against the homeland.Second, this contributed to a larger failure of analysis -- a failure to connect the dots of intelligence that existed across our intelligence community and which, together, could have revealed that Abdulmutallab was planning an attack.Third, this, in turn, fed into shortcomings in the watch-listing system which resulted in this person not being placed on the \"no fly\" list, thereby allowing him to board that plane in Amsterdam for Detroit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the U.S. government had the information -- scattered throughout the system -- to potentially uncover this plot and disrupt the attack.\u00a0 Rather than a failure to collect or share intelligence, this was a failure to connect and understand the intelligence that we already had.That's why we took swift action in the immediate days following Christmas, including reviewing and updating the terrorist watchlist system and adding more individuals to the \"no fly\" list, and directing our embassies and consulates to include current visa information in their warnings of individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist ties.\u00a0Today, I'm directing a series of additional corrective steps across multiple agencies.\u00a0 Broadly speaking, they fall into four areas.First, I'm directing that our intelligence community immediately begin assigning specific responsibility for investigating all leads on high-priority threats so that these leads are pursued and acted upon aggressively -- not just most of the time, but all of the time.\u00a0 We must follow the leads that we get.\u00a0 And we must pursue them until plots are disrupted.\u00a0 And that mean assigning clear lines of responsibility.Second, I'm directing that intelligence reports, especially those involving potential threats to the United States, be distributed more rapidly and more widely.\u00a0 We can't sit on information that could protect the American people.Third, I'm directing that we strengthen the analytical process, how our analysis -- how our analysts process and integrate the intelligence that they receive.\u00a0 My Director of National Intelligence, Denny Blair, will take the lead in improving our day-to-day efforts.\u00a0 My Intelligence Advisory Board will examine the longer-term challenge of sifting through vast universes of intelligence and data in our Information Age.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And finally, I'm ordering an immediate effort to strengthen the criteria used to add individuals to our terrorist watchlists, especially the \"no fly\" list.\u00a0 We must do better in keeping dangerous people off airplanes, while still facilitating air travel.So taken together, these reforms will improve the intelligence community's ability to collect, share, integrate, analyze, and act on intelligence swiftly and effectively.\u00a0 In short, they will help our intelligence community do its job even better and protect American lives.But even the best intelligence can't identify in advance every individual who would do us harm.\u00a0 So we need the security\u00a0-- at our airports, ports, and borders, and through our partnerships with other nations -- to prevent terrorists from entering America.\u00a0At the Amsterdam airport, Abdulmutallab was subjected to the same screening as other passengers.\u00a0 He was required to show his documents -- including a valid U.S. visa.\u00a0 His carry-on bag was X-rayed.\u00a0 He passed through a metal detector.\u00a0 But a metal detector can't detect the kind of explosives that were sewn into his clothes.As Secretary Napolitano will explain, the screening technologies that might have detected these explosives are in use at the Amsterdam airport, but not at the specific checkpoints that he passed through.\u00a0 Indeed, most airports in the world -- and in the United States -- do not yet have these technologies.\u00a0 Now, there's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flights into America each day, domestic and international.\u00a0 It will require significant investments in many areas.\u00a0 And that's why, even before the Christmas attack, we increased investments in homeland security and aviation security.\u00a0 This includes an additional one billion dollars in new systems and technologies that we need to protect our airports -- more baggage screening, more passenger screening and more advanced explosive detection capabilities, including those that can improve our ability to detect the kind of explosive used on Christmas.\u00a0 These are major investments and they'll make our skies safer and more secure.As I announced this week, we've taken a whole range of steps to improve aviation screening and security since Christmas, including new rules for how we handle visas within the government and enhanced screening for passengers flying from, or through, certain countries.\u00a0And today, I'm directing that the Department of Homeland Security take additional steps, including:\u00a0 strengthening our international partnerships to improve aviation screening and security around the world; greater use of the advanced explosive detection technologies that we already have, including imaging technology; and working aggressively, in cooperation with the Department of Energy and our National Labs, to develop and deploy the next generation of screening technologies.Now, there is, of course, no foolproof solution.\u00a0 As we develop new screening technologies and procedures, our adversaries will seek new ways to evade them, as was shown by the Christmas attack.\u00a0 In the never-ending race to protect our country, we have to stay one step ahead of a nimble adversary.\u00a0 That's what these steps are designed to do.\u00a0 And we will continue to work with Congress to ensure that our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement communities have the resources they need to keep the American people safe.I ordered these two immediate reviews so that we could take immediate action to secure our country.\u00a0 But in the weeks and months ahead, we will continue a sustained and intensive effort of analysis and assessment, so that we leave no stone unturned in seeking better ways to protect the American people.\u00a0\u00a0I have repeatedly made it clear -- in public with the American people, and in private with my national security team -- that I will hold my staff, our agencies and the people in them accountable when they fail to perform their responsibilities at the highest levels.\u00a0Now, at this stage in the review process it appears that this incident was not the fault of a single individual or organization, but rather a systemic failure across organizations and agencies.\u00a0 That's why, in addition to the corrective efforts that I've ordered, I've directed agency heads to establish internal accountability reviews, and directed my national security staff to monitor their efforts.\u00a0 We will measure progress.\u00a0 And John Brennan will report back to me within 30 days and on a regular basis after that.\u00a0 All of these agencies -- and their leaders -- are responsible for implementing these reforms. And all will be held accountable if they don't.\u00a0Moreover, I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correcting these mistakes to make us safer.\u00a0 For ultimately, the buck stops with me.\u00a0 As President, I have a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people.\u00a0 And when the system fails, it is my responsibility.\u00a0Over the past two weeks, we've been reminded again of the challenge we face in protecting our country against a foe that is bent on our destruction.\u00a0 And while passions and politics can often obscure the hard work before us, let's be clear about what this moment demands.\u00a0 We are at war.\u00a0 We are at war against al Qaeda, a far-reaching network of violence and hatred that attacked us on </p><p>9/11, that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, and that is plotting to strike us again.\u00a0 And we will do whatever it takes to defeat them.And we've made progress.\u00a0 Al Qaeda's leadership is hunkered down.\u00a0 We have worked closely with partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al Qaeda leaders.\u00a0 And we have disrupted plots at home and abroad, and saved American lives.And we know that the vast majority of Muslims reject al Qaeda.\u00a0 But it is clear that al Qaeda increasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations not just in the Middle East, but in Africa and other places, to do their bidding.\u00a0 That's why I've directed my national security team to develop a strategy that addresses the unique challenges posed by lone recruits.\u00a0 And that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world that al Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death \u0096- including the murder of fellow Muslims \u0096- while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress.To advance that progress, we've sought new beginnings with Muslim communities around the world, one in which we engage on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect, and work together to fulfill the aspirations that all people share -- to get an education, to work with dignity, to live in peace and security.\u00a0 That's what America believes in.\u00a0 That's the vision that is far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists.Here at home, we will strengthen our defenses, but we will not succumb to a siege mentality that sacrifices the open society and liberties and values that we cherish as Americans, because great and proud nations don't hunker down and hide behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.\u00a0 That is exactly what our adversaries want, and so long as I am President, we will never hand them that victory.\u00a0 We will define the character of our country, not some band of small men intent on killing innocent men, women and children.And in this cause, every one of us -- every American, every elected official -- can do our part.\u00a0 Instead of giving into cynicism and division, let's move forward with the confidence and optimism and unity that defines us as a people.\u00a0 For now is not a time for partisanship, it's a time for citizenship -- a time to come together and work together with the seriousness of purpose that our national security demands.That's what it means to be strong in the face of violent extremism.\u00a0 That's how we will prevail in this fight.\u00a0 And that's how we will protect our country and pass it -- safer and stronger -- to the next generation.Thanks very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": NaN, "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Speech on Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee", "article": "<p>[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</p><p>Thank you, everybody, for being here.</p><p>As we all know, our country has endured the deepest recession we've faced in generations.\u00a0And much of the turmoil was caused by irresponsibility on the part of banks and financial institutions. Firms took reckless risks in pursuit of short-term profits and soaring bonuses, triggering a financial crisis that nearly pulled the economy into a second Great Depression.</p><p>It was little more than a year ago that we stood on that precipice. Several of the world's largest financial institutions had already failed.\u00a0Credit markets froze and banks refused to lend.\u00a0Trillions of dollars in household savings evaporated as stocks, pensions, and home values plummeted.\u00a0And we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month.\u00a0It was at this time that many large financial firms -- those left standing -- teetered on the brink of collapse, overwhelmed by the consequences of their irresponsible decisions.</p><p>Now, even though these firms were largely facing a crisis of their own making, their failure could have led to an even greater calamity for the country. So the Federal Reserve and other agencies took emergency measures to prevent that outcome.\u00a0And the previous Administration started a program -- the </p><p>Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- to provide these financial institutions with funds to survive the turmoil that they had helped unleash.\u00a0It was a distasteful but necessary thing to do.</p><p>Now, we've worked over the last year to manage this program effectively, to hold firms accountable, and to recoup as much tax money as possible.\u00a0Many originally feared that most of the 700 billion dollars in TARP money would be lost.\u00a0But because of the management of this program by Secretary Geithner and my economic team, we've now recovered the majority of the funds provided to banks.As far as I'm concerned, however, that's not good enough.\u00a0My commitment is to the taxpayer.\u00a0 My commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are owed.\u00a0And my determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when I see reports of massive profits and obscene bonuses at some of the very firms who owe their continued existence to the American people -- folks who have not been made whole, and who continue to face real hardship in this recession.We want our money back. And we're going to get it.And that's why I'm proposing a \"Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee\" to be imposed on major financial firms until the American people are fully compensated for the extraordinary assistance they provided to Wall Street.\u00a0If these companies are in good enough shape to afford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to afford paying back every penny to taxpayers.Now, our estimate is that the TARP program will end up costing taxpayers around 117 billion dollars -- obviously a lot less than the 700 billion that people had feared, but still a lot of money.\u00a0The fee will be in place for 10 years, or as long as it takes to raise the full amount necessary to cover all taxpayer losses. This will not be a cost borne by community banks or small financial firms. Only the largest firms with more than 50 billion dollars in assets will be affected.\u00a0And the size of the fee each bank owes will be based on its size and exposure to debt, so that we are recovering tax dollars while promoting reform of the banking practices that contributed to this crisis.Now, the fact is these financial institutions are essential to our economy.\u00a0They provide capital and credit to families purchasing homes, students attending college, businesses seeking to start up or expand.\u00a0And that's why the rescue program was as necessary as it was unfortunate.\u00a0 And that is why, through this fee and broader reforms that we seek, our goal is not to punish Wall Street firms, but rather to prevent the abuse and excess that nearly caused the collapse of many of these firms and the financial system itself.We cannot go back to \"business as usual.\"\u00a0And when we see reports of firms once again engaging in risky bets to reap quick rewards, when we see a return to compensation practices that seem not to reflect what the country has been through, all that looks like business as usual to me.\u00a0The financial industry has even launched a massive lobbying campaign, locking arms with the opposition Party, to stand in the way of reforms to prevent another crisis. That, too, unfortunately, is business as usual. And we're already hearing a hue and cry from Wall Street suggesting that this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair -- that by some twisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the costs of the bailout, rather than the industry that benefited from it, even though these executives are out there giving themselves huge bonuses.What I'd say to these executives is this:\u00a0Instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight this proposal, or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee, I suggest you might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities.\u00a0And I'd urge you to cover the costs of the rescue not by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizens with the bill, but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and executives. And more broadly, I am continuing to call on these firms to put greater effort into helping families stay in their homes, to provide small businesses with needed loans, and to embrace -- rather than fight -- serious financial reform.Ultimately, it is by taking responsibility -- on Wall Street, here in Washington, all the way to Main Street -- that we're going to move past this period of turmoil.\u00a0That's how we're going to avoid the cycles of boom and bust that have caused so much havoc. That's how we're going to promote vibrant markets that reward innovation and entrepreneurship and hard work.\u00a0That's how we're going to create sustained growth without the looming threat of another costly crisis.\u00a0That's not only in the best interests of the economy as a whole; it's actually in the interest of these large banks.So, I'm going to be working closely with Congress on this proposal.And on behalf of the American people, I look forward to signing it into law.Thank you very much.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"name": NaN, "group_name": "Barack Obama", "group_id": 2, "headline": "Martin Luther King Remembrance Speech", "article": "<p>Good morning.\u00a0 Praise be to God.\u00a0 Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont Avenue Baptist Church family for welcoming our family here today.\u00a0 It feels like a family.\u00a0 Thank you for making us feel that way.\u00a0 To Pastor Wheeler, first lady Wheeler, thank you so much for welcoming us here today.\u00a0 Congratulations on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia.\u00a0 Michelle and I have been blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin Lucas Robinson.\u00a0 So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions.\u00a0Now, if Jordan's father is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is a great blessing.Michelle and Malia and Sasha and I are thrilled to be here today.\u00a0 And I know that sometimes you have to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker.\u00a0So let me apologize in advance for all the fuss. We gather here, on a Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for our world.\u00a0 In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a spirit of prayer; to seek solace among a community of believers.\u00a0 But we are not here just to ask the Lord for His blessing.\u00a0 We aren't here just to interpret His Scripture.\u00a0 We're also here to call on the memory of one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Now, it's fitting that we do so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church -- here, in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; here in a church formed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn the union blue; here in a church from whose pews congregants set out for marches and from whom choir anthems of freedom were heard; from whose sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time. One of those times was Thursday, December 6, 1956.\u00a0 Pastor, you said you were a little older than me, so were you around at that point?\u00a0You were three years old -- okay.\u00a0I wasn\u0092t born yet.\u00a0On Thursday, December 6, 1956.\u00a0 And before Dr. King had pointed us to the mountaintop, before he told us about his dream in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27-year-old preacher, to speak on what he called \"The Challenge of a New Age.\"\u00a0 \"The Challenge of a New Age.\"\u00a0 It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King and his followers -- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered the desegregation of Montgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381-day historic boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama. And yet, as Dr. King rose to take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting.\u00a0 It wasn't clear what would come next for the movement that Dr. King led.\u00a0 It wasn't clear how we were going to reach the Promised Land.\u00a0 Because segregation was still rife; lynchings still a fact.\u00a0 Yes, the Supreme Court had ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board of Education.\u00a0 And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by schools and by states; they ignored it with impunity.\u00a0 And here in the nation's capital, the federal government had yet to fully align itself with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding.\u00a0 So it's not hard for us, then, to imagine that moment.\u00a0 We can imagine folks coming to this church, happy about the boycott being over.\u00a0 We can also imagine them, though, coming here concerned about their future, sometimes second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off some creeping doubts, perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placed so many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- could actually deliver on its promise. So here we are, more than half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a new age.\u00a0 Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call the Joshua generation to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweat and blood, and sometimes life itself.\u00a0We've inherited the progress of unjust laws that are now overturned.\u00a0 We take for granted the progress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the time to actually vote. We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts, but irrevocably -- from human hearts.\u00a0 It's that progress that made it possible for me to be here today; for the good people of this country to elect an African American the 44th President of the United States of America.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Reverend Wheeler mentioned the inauguration, last year's election.\u00a0 You know, on the heels of that victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we had entered into a post-racial America, all those problems would be solved.\u00a0 There were those who argued that because I had spoke of a need for unity in this country that our nation was somehow entering into a period of post-partisanship.\u00a0 That didn\u0092t work out so well.\u00a0 There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath. Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled.\u00a0 Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before. Unemployment is at its highest level in more than a quarter of a century.\u00a0 Nowhere is it higher than the African American community.\u00a0 Poverty is on the rise.\u00a0 Home ownership is slipping. Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitian brothers and sisters are in desperate need.\u00a0 Bruised, battered, many people are legitimately feeling doubt, even despair, about the future.\u00a0 Like those who came to this church on that Thursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we go from here? I understand those feelings.\u00a0 I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so many folks feel as they struggle to stay afloat.\u00a0 I get letters from folks around the country every day; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that we receive.\u00a0 And there are stories of hardship and desperation, in some cases, pleading for help:\u00a0 I need a job.\u00a0 I'm about to lose my home.\u00a0 I don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt.\u00a0 Sometimes you get letters from children:\u00a0 My mama or my daddy have lost their jobs, is there something you can do to help?\u00a0 Ten letters like that a day we read.So, yes, we're passing through a hard winter.\u00a0 It's the hardest in some time.\u00a0 But let's always remember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some hard winters before.\u00a0 This country was founded during some harsh winters.\u00a0 The fishermen, the laborers, the craftsmen who made camp at Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter.\u00a0 The slaves and the freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice under the cover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress whose feet were tired, the pastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- they weathered some hard winters.\u00a0 It was for them, as it is for us, difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming.\u00a0 They, too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate.\u00a0 And yet, each season, the frost melts, the cold recedes, the sun reappears.\u00a0 So it was for earlier generations and so it will be for us. What we need to do is to just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generations about how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they persevered and prevailed.\u00a0 Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame.\u00a0 Let me offer a few thoughts on this.\u00a0 First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in their resolve.\u00a0 Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by shoving and punching and spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that sweet spirit of resistance, the principles of nonviolence that had accounted for their success. Second, they understood that as much as our government and our political parties had betrayed them in the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals -- government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and must be\u00a0 -- a force for good.\u00a0 So they stayed on the Justice Department.\u00a0 They went into the courts.\u00a0 They pressured Congress, they pressured their President.\u00a0 They didn\u0092t give up on this country. They didn\u0092t give up on government.\u00a0 They didn\u0092t somehow say government was the problem; they said, we're going to change government, we're going to make it better.\u00a0 Imperfect as it was, they continued to believe in the promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remake itself, to perfect this union. Third, our predecessors were never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn't see progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks just don't want to see that even if we don't get everything, we're getting something.\u00a0King understood that the desegregation of the Armed Forces didn\u0092t end the civil rights movement, because black and white soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter when they came home.\u00a0 But he still insisted on the rightness of desegregating the Armed Forces.\u00a0 That was a good first step -- even as he called for more.\u00a0 He didn\u0092t suggest that somehow by the signing of the Civil Rights that somehow all discrimination would end.\u00a0 But he also didn\u0092t think that we shouldn\u0092t sign the Civil Rights Act because it hasn\u0092t solved every problem.\u00a0 Let's take a victory, he said, and then keep on marching.\u00a0 Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for what they were -- which was progress. Fourth, at the core of King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts and opened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of justice, of equality -- that spoke to all people, not just some people.\u00a0 For King understood that without broad support, any movement for civil rights could not be sustained.\u00a0 That's why he marched with the white auto worker in Detroit.\u00a0 That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm worker in California, and united people of all colors in the noble quest for freedom. Of course, King overcame in other ways as well.\u00a0 He remained strategically focused on gaining ground -- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would not be easy, understand that change wouldn't come overnight, understanding that there would be setbacks and false starts along the way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that \"we can walk and never get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised land of freedom and justice.\" And it's because the Moses generation overcame that the trials we face today are very different from the ones that tested us in previous generations.\u00a0 Even after the worst recession in generations, life in America is not even close to being as brutal as it was back then for so many.\u00a0 That's the legacy of Dr. King and his movement.\u00a0 That's our inheritance.\u00a0 Having said that, let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their own right, and we must face them as squarely as they faced the challenges they saw. I know it's been a hard road we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economy is growing again.\u00a0 The job losses have finally slowed, and around the country, there's signs that businesses and families are beginning to rebound.\u00a0 We are making progress.I know it's been a hard road that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform.\u00a0 I promise you I know.\u00a0 But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance companies won't be able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 million people -- our fellow Americans will finally have insurance.\u00a0 More than 30 million men and women and children, mothers and fathers, won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick.\u00a0 This will be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity and decency, for our common humanity.\u00a0 This will be a victory for the United States of America. Let's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is.\u00a0 I know people can feel down about the way things are going sometimes here in Washington.\u00a0 I know it's tempting to give up on the political process.\u00a0 But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics and transparency -- tougher rules than any administration in history.\u00a0 It's not enough, but it's progress.\u00a0 Progress is possible.\u00a0 Don't give up on voting.\u00a0 Don't give up on advocacy.\u00a0 Don't give up on activism.\u00a0 There are too many needs to be met, too much work to be done.\u00a0 Like Dr. King said, \"We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope.\" Let us broaden our coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, not of red states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting today, and searching for a better tomorrow.\u00a0 The urgency of the hour demands that we make common cause with all of America's workers -- white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by this recession, all of whom are yearning for that spring to come.\u00a0 It demands that we reach out to those who've been left out in the cold even when the economy is good, even when we're not in recession -- the youth in the inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people in rural communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long time.\u00a0 It demands that we fight discrimination, whatever form it may come.\u00a0 That means we fight discrimination\u00a0 against gays and lesbians, and we make common cause to reform our immigration system.</p><p>And finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't just come from without -- it also has to come from within.\u00a0 And over the past year, for example, we've made meaningful improvements in the field of education.\u00a0 I've got a terrific Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\u00a0 He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. school district, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on accountability.\u00a0 We we're putting in more money and we've provided more Pell Grants and more tuition tax credits and simpler financial aid forms.\u00a0 We've done all that, but parents still need to parent.\u00a0 Kids still need to own up to their responsibilities.\u00a0 We still have to set high expectations for our young people.\u00a0 Folks can't simply look to government for all the answers without also looking inside themselves, inside their own homes, for some of the answers. Progress will only come if we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense of responsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to the African American community.\u00a0 Sometimes when I say these things people assme, well, he's just talking to black people about working hard.\u00a0 No, no, no, no.\u00a0 I'm talking to the American community.\u00a0 Because somewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some of our core values.\u00a0 You know what I'm talking about.\u00a0 We became enraptured with the false prophets who prophesized an easy path to success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and get-rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a celebrity; it doesn\u0092t matter what you do, as long as you get on TV.\u00a0 That's everybody. We forgot what made the bus boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement a success; what made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, there's no substitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, no substitute for being responsible stewards of God's blessings. </p><p>What we're called to do, then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up.\u00a0 To reinvest in the essentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like education, like a better energy policy, like basic infrastructure, like scientific research.\u00a0 Our generation is called to buckle down and get back to basics. We must do so not only for ourselves, but also for our children, and their children.\u00a0 For Jordan and for Austin.\u00a0 That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make.\u00a0 It's a much smaller sacrifice than the Moses generation had to make, but it's still a sacrifice.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, it's hard to transition to a clean energy economy.\u00a0 Sometimes it may be inconvenient, but it's a sacrifice that we have to make.\u00a0 It's hard to be fiscally responsible when we have all these human needs, and we're inheriting enormous deficits and debt, but that's a sacrifice that we're going to have to make.\u00a0 You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just put your kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them -- instead of reading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully accept.\u00a0 Sometimes it's hard to be a good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a good neighbor, or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give something of ourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as Michelle and I are urging folks to do tomorrow to honor and celebrate Dr. King.\u00a0 But these are sacrifices that we are called to make.\u00a0 These are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make.\u00a0 Our faith in the future.\u00a0 Our faith in America.\u00a0 Our faith in God.\u00a0 And on his sermon all those years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse: </p><p>Truth forever on the scaffoldWrong forever on the throne\u0085And behind the dim unknown stands GodWithin the shadows keeping watch above his own. Even as Dr. King stood in this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, he trusted God.\u00a0 He trusted that God would make a way.\u00a0 A way for prayers to be answered.\u00a0 A way for our union to be perfected.\u00a0 A way for the arc of the moral universe, no matter how long, to slowly bend towards truth and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice.\u00a0 He had faith that God would make a way out of no way.You know, folks ask me sometimes why I look so calm.\u00a0They say, all this stuff coming at you, how come you just seem calm?\u00a0 And I have a confession to make here.\u00a0 There are times where I'm not so calm.\u00a0Reggie Love knows.\u00a0 My wife knows.\u00a0 There are times when progress seems too slow.\u00a0 There are times when the words that are spoken about me hurt.\u00a0 There are times when the barbs sting.\u00a0 There are times when it feels like all these efforts are for naught, and change is so painfully slow in coming, and I have to confront my own doubts.\u00a0 But let me tell you -- during those times it's faith that keeps me calm.\u00a0It's faith that gives me peace.\u00a0 The same faith that leads a single mother to work two jobs to put a roof over her head when she has doubts.\u00a0 The same faith that keeps an unemployed father to keep on submitting job applications even after he's been rejected a hundred times.\u00a0 The same faith that says to a teacher even if the first nine children she's teaching she can't reach, that that 10th one she's going to be able to reach.\u00a0 The same faith that breaks the silence of an earthquake's wake with the sound of prayers and hymns sung by a Haitian community.\u00a0 A faith in things not seen, in better days ahead, in Him who holds the future in the hollow of His hand.\u00a0 A faith that lets us mount up on wings like eagles; lets us run and not be weary; lets us walk and not faint. So let us hold fast to that faith, as Joshua held fast to the faith of his fathers, and together, we shall overcome the challenges of a new age.\u00a0Together, we shall seize the promise of this moment.\u00a0 Together, we shall make a way through winter, and we're going to welcome the spring.\u00a0 Through God all things are possible.May the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King continue to inspire us and ennoble our world and all who inhabit it.\u00a0 And may God bless the United States of America.Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 God bless you.</p>", "color": "#1f6bb8", "radius": "7"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-84.389488, 33.791638]}}]}
